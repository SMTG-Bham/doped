### Stuff to add:
- Function to generate `vasp_std` chemical potential relaxation files, given input converged k-points (`make_converged_kpts`, `vasp_std_chempot_relax`, `vasp_ncl_chempot`).
- Note about cost of `vasp_ncl` chemical potential calculations for metals, use `ISMEAR = -5`, possibly `NKRED` etc. (make a function to generate `vasp_ncl` calculation files with `ISMEAR = -5`, with option to set different kpoints) - if ISMEAR = 0 - converged kpoints still prohibitively large, use vasp_converge_files again to check for quicker convergence with ISMEAR = -5.
- Use `NKRED = 2` for `vasp_ncl` chempot calcs, if even kpoints and over 4. Often can't use `NKRED` with `vasp_std`, because we don't know beforehand the kpts in the IBZ (because symmetry on for `vasp_std` chempot calcs)(same goes for `EVENONLY = True`).
- Add `defects_std_to_ncl.sh` bash script to auto-generate symmetrised `KPOINTS` for SOC `vasp_ncl` run from `vasp_std` IBZKPT, and copy `vasp_std/CONTCAR` to `vasp_ncl/POSCAR`, copy `CHGCAR`, `POTCAR` over etc. (Make note about symmetrised k-points required for accurate SOC bandstructures, VASP wizardry with Chris, but not an issue for ground state energies).
- Add `chempot_std_to_ncl.sh` bash script to auto-generate non-symmetrised `KPOINTS` for SOC `vasp_ncl` run (note on editing `module load vasp` command), and copy `vasp_std/CONTCAR` to `vasp_ncl/POSCAR`, copy `CHGCAR`, `POTCAR` over etc.
- Use `UserChemPotAnalyzer` to parse chemical potential calculations
- Add `dope_stuff` examples and documentation.
- `transition_levels_table()`
- Note about SOC for chemical potential calculations (Lany says: to ‘a good approximation’, the SOC contributions to total energy can be separated into purely atomic contributions, Lany, Stevanovic and Zunger show in their FERE paper (https://doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevB.85.115104) that the SOC effects on total energy cancel out for chemical potential calculations) - But only for easy systems - better to do consistently
- `NKRED` pre-relaxing on defect structures (see jspark Slack discussion)
- Build in `emphasis` option to `formation_energy_plot`, label 0 as VBM and CBM on x-axis
- Note that if you edit the entries in a DefectPhaseDiagram after creating it, you need to `dpd.find_stable_charges()` to update the transition level map etc.
- `rattle` function and notes about finding stable ground state structures (what about the bond distortion method for finding polarons?)
- `aide` labelling of defect species in formation energy plots.
- Note about `ISPIN = 1` for even no. of electrons defect species, **if you're sure there's no magnetic ordering!
