    - Automatic charge correction determination and application
    - Improved error handling and more informative warning messages
- Add `test_defectsmaker.py`, `test_corrections.py` and `test_analysis.py` -> significantly improve test coverage
- Add `_convert_dielectric_to_tensor()` function to be more flexible to user input
- Remove old unsupported/deprecated code.
- Add check and warning if multiple output files (`vasprun.xml`/`OUTCAR`/`LOCPOT`) present in bulk/defect directory.

- Major overhaul of `vasp_input` functions setup to be far more streamlined and customisable.
- Major overhaul of `chemical_potentials` code; now with improved algorithm for selecting potential competing phases
- Update of example notebooks
- Add tests for parsing calculations, chemical_potentials and vasp_input
- Add GH Actions workflows (for tests, GH releases and pypi packaging)
- Adopt recommended versioning convention based on dates
- General tidy up, docstring padding, formatting and `TODO` addition/removal
- Ensure all inputs/outputs are `JSON`able, now recommending this for better forward/backward compatibility
