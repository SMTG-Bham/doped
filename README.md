<a href="https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"><img align="right" width="275" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SMTG-UCL/doped/master/docs/doped_v2_logo.png"></a>`doped` is a python package for
managing solid-state defect calculations, with functionality to
generate defect structures and relevant competing phases (for chemical potentials), interface with
[`ShakeNBreak`](https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io) for
[defect structure-searching](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-023-00973-1), write VASP input files for defect
supercell calculations, and automatically parse and analyse the results.

Tutorials showing the code functionality and usage are provided on the [docs](https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) site.

### Example Outputs:
Chemical potential/stability region plots and defect formation energy (a.k.a. transition level) diagrams:

## Installation
```bash
pip install doped  # install doped and dependencies
```

Alternatively if desired, `doped` can also be installed from `conda` with:

```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge doped
```

If you haven't done so already, you will need to set up your VASP `POTCAR` files and `Materials Project` API with `pymatgen` using the `.pmgrc.yaml` file, in order for `doped` to automatically generate VASP input files for defect calculations and determine competing phases for chemical potentials.
See the docs [Installation](https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html) page for details on this.



## `ShakeNBreak`
As shown in the example notebook, it is highly recommended to use the [`ShakeNBreak`](https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) approach when calculating point defects in solids, to ensure you have identified the groundstate structures of your defects. As detailed in the [theory paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09862), skipping this step can result in drastically incorrect formation energies, transition levels, carrier capture (basically any property associated with defects). This approach is followed in the [doped example notebook](https://github.com/SMTG-UCL/doped/blob/master/dope_workflow_example.ipynb), with a more in-depth explanation and tutorial given on the [ShakeNBreak](https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) website.

## Acknowledgments
`doped` (nÃ©e `DefectsWithTheBoys` #iykyk) has benefitted from feedback from many users, in particular
members of the [Scanlon](http://davidscanlon.com/) and [Walsh](https://wmd-group.github.io/) research groups who have used / are using it in their work. Direct contributors are listed in the `Contributors` sidebar above; including SeÃ¡n Kavanagh, Bonan Zhu, Katarina Brlec, Adair Nicolson,
Sabrine Hachmioune and Savya Aggarwal.

Code to efficiently identify defect species from input supercell structures was contributed by Dr
[Alex Ganose](https://github.com/utf), and the colour scheme for defect formation energy plots was originally templated from
the `aide` package, developed by the dynamic duo [Adam Jackson](https://github.com/ajjackson) and [Alex Ganose](https://github.com/utf).

The [docs](https://readthedocs.io) website setup was templated from the `ShakeNBreak` docs set up by [Irea Mosquera-Lois](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=oIMzt0cAAAAJ&hl=en) ðŸ™Œ

`doped` was originally based on the excellent
[PyCDT](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465518300079) (no longer maintained), but transformed
and morphed over time as more and more functionality was added. After breaking changes in `pymatgen`, the package was
entirely refactored and rewritten, to work with the new
`pymatgen-analysis-defects` package.

## Studies using `doped`

We'll add papers that use `doped` to this list as they come out!
