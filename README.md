This is a (mid-development) Python package for managing solid-state defect calculations,
geared toward VASP. Much of it is a modified version of the excellent [PyCDT](https://bitbucket.org/mbkumar/pycdt).  
See [this link](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010465518300079) for the original PyCDT paper.

Defect formation energy plots are templated from [AIDE](https://github.com/SMTG-UCL/aide) and follow the aesthetics
philosopy of [sumo](https://smtg-ucl.github.io/sumo/), both developed by the dynamic duo Adam Jackson and Alex Ganose.

Example Jupyter notebooks (the `.ipynb` files) are provided in [examples](examples) to show the code functionality and usage.

## Requirements
`doped` requires pymatgen (and its dependencies).

## Installation
1. `doped` can be installed from `PyPI` with `pip install doped`. 

2. (If not set) Set the VASP pseudopotential directory in `$HOME/.pmgrc.yaml` as follows::
```bash
  PMG_VASP_PSP_DIR: <Path to VASP pseudopotential top directory>
```
Within your `VASP pseudopotential top directory`, you should have a folder named `POT_GGA_PAW_PBE` which contains the `POTCAR.X(.gz)` files (in this case for PBE `POTCAR`s).

(Necessary to generate `POTCAR` files, auto-determine `INCAR` settings such as `NELECT` for charged defects...)

3(Optional) Set the Materials Project API key in `$HOME/.pmgrc.yaml` as follows::
```bash
  MAPI_KEY: <Your mapi key obtained from www.materialsproject.org>
```
(For pulling structures and comparing properties with the Materials Project database).


## `ShakeNBreak`
As shown in the example notebook, it is highly recommended to use the [`ShakeNBreak`](https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) approach when calculating point defects in solids, to ensure you have identified the groundstate structures of your defects. As detailed in the [theory paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.09862), skipping this step can result in drastically incorrect formation energies, transition levels, carrier capture (basically any property associated with defects). This approach is followed in the [doped example notebook](https://github.com/SMTG-UCL/doped/blob/master/dope_Example_Notebook.ipynb), with a more in-depth explanation and tutorial given on the [ShakeNBreak](https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) website.

### Developer Installation

1. Download the `doped` source code using the command:
```bash
  git clone https://github.com/SMTG-UCL/doped
```
2.  Navigate to root directory:
```bash
  cd doped
```
3.  Install the code, using the command:
```bash
  pip install -e .
```
This command tries to obtain the required packages and their dependencies and install them automatically.
Access to root may be needed if ``virtualenv`` is not used.


## Word of Caution
There is quite possibly a couple of bugs in this code, as it is very much still experimental and in development.
If you find any, please let us know!
