  abstract = {The development of high-power anode materials for Na-ion batteries is one of the primary obstacles due to the growing demands for their use in the smart grid. Despite the appealingly low cost and non-toxicity, Na2Ti3O7 suffers from low electrical conductivity and poor structural stability, which restricts its use in high-power applications. Viable approaches for overcoming these drawbacks reported to date are aliovalent doping and hydrogenation/hydrothermal treatments, both of which are closely intertwined with native defects. There is still a lack of knowledge, however, of the intrinsic defect chemistry of Na2Ti3O7, which impairs the rational design of high-power titanate anodes. Here, we report hybrid density functional theory calculations of the native defect chemistry of Na2Ti3O7. The defect calculations show that the insulating properties of Na2Ti3O7 arise from the Na and O Schottky disorder that act as major charge compensators. Under high-temperature hydrogenation treatment, these Schottky pairs of Na and O vacancies become dominant defects in Na2Ti3O7, triggering the spontaneous partial phase transition to Na2Ti6O13 and improving the electrical conductivity of the composite anode. Our findings provide an explanation on the interplay between intrinsic defects, structural phase transitions, and electrical conductivity, which can aid understanding of the properties of composite materials obtained from phase transitions.},

  abstract = {The complex interrelationships among thermoelectric parameters mean that a priori design of high-performing materials is difficult. However, band engineering can allow the power factor to be optimized through enhancement of the Seebeck coefficient. Herein, using layered Sb2Si2Te6 and Sc2Si2Te6 as model systems, we comprehensively investigate and compare their thermoelectric properties by employing density functional theory combined with semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory. Our simulations reveal that Sb2Si2Te6 exhibits superior electrical conductivity compared to Sc2Si2Te6 due to lower scattering rates and more pronounced band dispersion. Remarkably, despite Sb2Si2Te6 exhibiting a lower lattice thermal conductivity, the introduction of Sc-d orbitals dramatically increases conduction band degeneracy in Sc2Si2Te6, yielding a significantly improved Seebeck coefficient relative to Sb2Si2Te6. As a result, Sc2Si2Te6 is predicted to achieve an extraordinary dimensionless figure of merit (ZT) of 3.51 at 1000 K, which significantly surpasses the predicted maximum ZT of 2.76 for Sb2Si2Te6 at 900 K. This work suggests that engineering band degeneracy through compositional variation is an effective strategy for improving the thermoelectric performance of layered materials.},

Herein, we investigate cation-disordered NaBiS2 nanocrystals, which have a steep absorption onset, with absorption coefficients reaching {$>$}105\,cm-1 just above its pseudo-direct bandgap of 1.4\,eV. Surprisingly, we also observe an ultrafast (picosecond-time scale) photoconductivity decay and long-lived charge-carrier population persisting for over one microsecond in NaBiS2 nanocrystals. These unusual features arise because of the localised, non-bonding S p character of the upper valence band, which leads to a high density of electronic states at the band edges, ultrafast localisation of spatially-separated electrons and holes, as well as the slow decay of trapped holes. This work reveals the critical role of cation disorder in these systems on both absorption characteristics and charge-carrier kinetics.},

Significant rearrangement of the Ta-Ni-Se layers is observed, in particular a very significant relative displacement of the layers compared to the parent phase, similar to that which occurs under hydrostatic pressure. Neutron powder diffraction experiments and computational analysis confirm that Li occupies a distorted triangular prismatic site formed by Se atoms of adjacent Ta2NiSe5 layers with an average Li{\textendash}Se bond length of 2.724(2) {\AA}. Li-NMR experiments show a single Li environment at ambient temperature. Intercalation suppresses the distortion to monoclinic symmetry that occurs in Ta2NiSe5 at 328 K and that is believed to be driven by the formation of an excitonic insulating state. Magnetometry data show that the reduced phase has a smaller net diamagnetic susceptibility than Ta2NiSe5 due to the enhancement of the temperature-independent Pauli paramagnetism caused by the increased density of states at the Fermi level evident also from the calculations, consistent with the injection of electrons during intercalation and formation of a metallic phase.},

Perovskite-inspired materials have emerged as promising candidates for this goal, with researchers employing materials design strategies including structural, dimensional, and compositional transformations to avoid the use of rare and toxic elemental constituents, while attempting to maintain high optoelectronic performance. These strategies have recently been invoked to propose Ti-based vacancy-ordered halide perovskites (A2TiX6; A = CH3NH3, Cs, Rb, or K; X = I, Br, or Cl) for photovoltaic operation, following the initial promise of Cs2SnX6 compounds. Theoretical investigations of these materials, however, consistently overestimate their band gaps, a fundamental property for photovoltaic applications. Here, we reveal strong excitonic effects as the origin of this discrepancy between theory and experiment, a consequence of both low structural dimensionality and band localization. These findings have vital implications for the optoelectronic application of these compounds while also highlighting the importance of frontier-orbital character for chemical substitution in materials design strategies.},

Consideration of the defect dynamics, and symmetry-breaking, changes the qualitative behaviour and activates new pathways for carrier capture.

Our calculations reveal that the band gaps of MPn span the optimal range for solar absorption. We find that NaP, composed of earth-abundant elements, has excellent properties as a solar cell absorber, including a slightly indirect band gap, high optical absorption coefficient just above the absorption onset, light electron and hole effective masses, and ambipolar dopability. However, carrier capture calculations show that P vacancies may limit its photovoltaic performance. Therefore, we propose solutions to reduce P vacancies through chemical potential control. Finally, we present preliminary results of NaP powder sample growth; this reveals a direct band gap of 1.66 eV, close to the predicted value of 1.62 eV.

In this work, we use hybrid density functional theory to identify a binary Sb(V) system, Sb2O5, as a promising TCO with high conductivity and transparency when doped with fluorine. We have conducted a full point defect analysis, finding F-doped Sb2O5 to exhibit degenerate n-type transparent conducting behavior. The inherently large electron affinity found in antimony oxides also widens its application in organic solar cells.

  abstract = {Lead toxicity and poor stability under operating conditions are major drawbacks that impede the widespread commercialization of metal{\textendash}halide perovskite solar cells. Ti(IV) has been considered as an alternative species to replace Pb(II) because it is relatively nontoxic and abundant and its perovskite-like compounds have demonstrated promising performance when applied in solar cells ({$\eta$} {$>$} 3\%), photocatalysts, and nonlinear optical applications. Yet, Ti(IV) perovskites show instability in air, hindering their use. On the other hand, Sn(IV) has a similar cationic radius to Ti(IV), adopting the same vacancy-ordered double perovskite (VODP) structure and showing good stability in ambient conditions. We report here a combined experimental and computational study on mixed titanium{\textendash}tin bromide and iodide VODPs, motivated by the hypothesis that these mixtures may show a stability higher than that of the pure titanium compositions. Thermodynamic analysis shows that the cations are highly miscible in these vacancy-ordered structures. Experimentally, we synthesized mixed titanium{\textendash}tin VODPs as nanocrystals across the entire mixing range x (Cs2Ti1{\textendash}xSnxX6; X = I or Br), using a colloidal synthetic approach. Analysis of the experimental and computed absorption spectra reveals weak hybridization and interactions between Sn and Ti octahedra with the alloy absorption being essentially a linear combination of the pure Sn and Ti compositions. These compounds are stabilized at high percentages of Sn (x of {$\sim$}60\%), as expected, with bromide compositions demonstrating greater stability compared to the iodides. Overall, we find that these materials behave akin to molecular aggregates, with the thermodynamic and optoelectronic properties governed by the intraoctahedral interactions.},

The standard modelling approach is, however, prone to missing the ground state atomic configurations associated with energy-lowering reconstructions from the idealised crystallographic environment. Missed ground states compromise the accuracy of calculated properties. To address this issue, we report an approach to navigate the defect configurational landscape using targeted bond distortions and rattling. Application of our workflow to eight materials (CdTe, GaAs, Sb2S3, Sb2Se3, CeO2, In2O3, ZnO, anatase-TiO2) reveals symmetry breaking in each host crystal that is not found via conventional local minimisation techniques. The point defect distortions are classified by the associated physico-chemical factors. We demonstrate the impact of these defect distortions on derived properties, including formation energies, concentrations and charge transition levels. Our work presents a step forward for quantitative modelling of imperfect solids.},

The theoretical description of defect formation in crystals has evolved substantially over the past century. Advances in supercomputing hardware, and the integration of new computational techniques such as machine learning, provide an opportunity to model longer length and time-scales than previously possible. In this Tutorial Review, we cover the description of free energies for defect formation at finite temperatures, including configurational (structural, electronic, spin) and vibrational terms. We discuss challenges in accounting for metastable defect configurations, progress such as machine learning force fields and thermodynamic integration to directly access entropic contributions, and bottlenecks in going beyond the dilute limit of defect formation. Such developments are necessary to support a new era of accurate defect predictions in computational materials chemistry.},

To understand the behaviour of defects and their impact on physical properties, it is necessary to identify the most stable defect geometries. However, global structure searching is computationally challenging for high-throughput defect studies or materials with complex defect landscapes, like alloys or disordered solids. Here, we tackle this limitation by harnessing a machine-learning surrogate model to qualitatively explore the defect structural landscape. By learning defect motifs in a family of related metal chalcogenide and mixed anion crystals, the model successfully predicts favourable reconstructions for unseen defects in unseen compositions for 90\% of cases, thereby reducing the number of first-principles calculations by 73\%. Using CdSe\$\_x\$Te\$\_\{1-x\}\$ alloys as an exemplar, we train a model on the end member compositions and apply it to find the stable geometries of all inequivalent vacancies for a range of mixing concentrations, thus enabling more accurate and faster defect studies for configurational complex systems.},

We have developed an automated workflow and code to accelerate these calculations (AiiDA-defects), which utilises the AiiDA framework, a robust open-source high-throughput materials informatics infrastructure that provides workflow automation while simultaneously preserving and storing the full data provenance in a relational database that is queryable and traversable. This paper describes the design and implementation details of AiiDA-defects, the models and algorithms used, and demonstrates its use in an application to fully characterize the defect chemistry of the well known solid-state Li-ion conductors LiZnPS               4               .

  abstract = {Inevitably, all crystalline materials will contain imperfections that have the ability to modify the properties of the host material. Key to the development of advanced materials is the ability to predict the concentrations of different defects in any given environmental conditions and how the change in the defect population alters the material's properties. Modern first principles atomistic simulation techniques, such as density functional theory (DFT), are now widely employed for the simulation of point defects, however, to develop true insight into a material's defect chemistry, it is essential to link the energies calculated to thermodynamic variables that fully describe its operating conditions. The Defect Analysis Package (DefAP), an open-source Python code, has been designed to fulfil this role. The primary function of the package is to predict the concentrations of defects in materials as a function of key thermodynamic variables, such as temperature and availability of different species, expressed through chemical potentials. Through simple thermodynamic equations, DefAP allows the rapid exploration of a material's defect chemistry allowing direct comparison with experimental observations. Rapid exploration is supported through the use of autoplotting with carefully considered automatic data labelling and simplification options enabling production of publication quality plots. DefAP offers a wide range of options for the calculation of defect and carrier concentrations that can be customised by the user to suit the material studied and an extensive suite of options have been designed for the study of extrinsic defects (e.g. dopants or impurities). The capabilities of DefAP are demonstrated in this paper by studying intrinsic defects in YBa2Cu3O7, P doping in Si, Am accumulation in PuO2, and simultaneous build-up of T and He in Li2TiO3.},

We find it to have an ideal, direct bandgap of 1.52 eV and a maximum efficiency of 30\% for a 1.5 {$\mu$}m-thick film at the radiative limit. Using hybrid density functional theory, the formation energies of all intrinsic defects are calculated, revealing the p-type copper vacancy as the dominant defect species, which forms a perturbed host state. Overall, defect concentrations are predicted to be low and have limited impact on non-radiative recombination, as a consequence of the p{\textendash}d coupling and antibonding character at the valence band maxima.

The pymatgen library aims to meet these needs by (1) defining core Python objects for materials data representation, (2) providing a well-tested set of structure and thermodynamic analyses relevant to many applications, and (3) establishing an open platform for researchers to collaboratively develop sophisticated analyses of materials data obtained both from first principles calculations and experiments. The pymatgen library also provides convenient tools to obtain useful materials data via the Materials Project's REpresentational State Transfer (REST) Application Programming Interface (API). As an example, using pymatgen's interface to the Materials Project's RESTful API and phasediagram package, we demonstrate how the phase and electrochemical stability of a recently synthesized material, Li4SnS4, can be analyzed using a minimum of computing resources. We find that Li4SnS4 is a stable phase in the Li{\textendash}Sn{\textendash}S phase diagram (consistent with the fact that it can be synthesized), but the narrow range of lithium chemical potentials for which it is predicted to be stable would suggest that it is not intrinsically stable against typical electrodes used in lithium-ion batteries.},

Herein, a variety of modeling techniques are used to investigate the charge transport properties of CuI, and limitations to the hole mobility over experimentally achievable carrier concentrations are discussed. Poor dielectric response is responsible for extensive scattering from ionized impurities at degenerately doped carrier concentrations, while phonon scattering is found to dominate at lower carrier concentrations. A phonon-limited hole mobility of 162 cm2 V{\textendash}1 s{\textendash}1 is predicted at room temperature. The simulated charge transport properties for CuI are compared to existing experimental data, and the implications for future device performance are discussed. In addition to charge transport calculations, the defect chemistry of CuI is investigated with hybrid functionals, revealing that reasonably localized holes from the copper vacancy are the predominant source of charge carriers. The chalcogens S and Se are investigated as extrinsic dopants, where it is found that despite relatively low defect formation energies, they are unlikely to act as efficient electron acceptors due to the strong localization of holes and subsequent deep transition levels.},

  abstract = {The combination of optical transparency and bipolar dopability in a single material would revolutionize modern opto-electronics. Of the materials known to be both p- and n-type dopable (such as SnO and CuInO2), none can satisfy the requirements for both p- and n-type transparent conducting applications. In the present work, perovskite BaSnO3 is investigated as a candidate material: its n-type properties are well characterized, with La-doping yielding degenerate conductivity and record electron mobility, while it has been suggested on a handful of occasions to be p-type dopable. Herein, group 1 metals Li, Na, and K and group 13 metals Al, Ga, and In are assessed as p-type acceptor defects in BaSnO3 using a hybrid density functional theory. It is found that while K and In can induce hole concentrations up to      10  16 \,   cm  - 3, the low energy oxygen vacancy pins the Fermi level in the bandgap and ultimately prevents metallic p-type conductivity being achieved in BaSnO3. Nevertheless, the predicted hole concentrations exceed experimentally reported values for K-doped BaSnO3, suggesting that the performance of a transparent p{\textendash}n homo-junction made from this material could be significantly improved.},

Here we probe the charged iodine vacancy distribution and transport at the junction between cubic and hexagonal polytypes of CsPbI3 from first-principles materials modeling. We predict a lower defect formation energy in the face-sharing regions, which correlates with a longer Pb{\textendash}I bond length and causes a million-fold increase in local defect concentration. These defects are predicted to be more mobile in the face-sharing regions with a reduced activation energy for vacancy-mediated diffusion. We conclude that hexagonal phase inclusions or interfaces will act as defect sinks that could influence carrier dynamics in perovskite-based solar cells and electrical devices.},

Finding an optimal spin-photon interface in silicon would move quantum information technologies toward a mature semiconducting host. However, the space of possible charged defects is vast, making the identification of candidates from experiments alone extremely challenging. Here, we use high-throughput first-principles computational screening to identify spin-photon interfaces among more than 1000 charged defects in silicon. The use of a single-shot hybrid functional approach is critical in enabling the screening of many quantum defects with a reasonable accuracy. We identify three promising spin-photon interfaces as potential bright emitters in the telecom band:  {$T$} {$i$} {$i$} + ,  {$F$} {$e$} {$i$} 0 , and  {$R$} {$u$} {$i$} 0 . These candidates are excited through defect-bound excitons, stressing the importance of such defects in silicon for telecom band operations. Our work paves the way to further large-scale computational screening for quantum defects in semiconductors.},

Using examples from current research we illustrate how the scope and applications of atomistic simulations have widened with time and yet still follow an approach readily identifiable with this early work. Firstly we discuss the use of the Mott{\textendash}Littleton methodology to study the segregation of various isovalent cations to the (00.1) and (01.2) surfaces of haematite ({$\alpha$}-Fe2O3). The results show that the size of the impurities has a considerable effect on the magnitude of the segregation energy. We then extend these simulations to investigate the effect of the concentration of the impurities at the surface on the segregation process using a supercell approach. We consider next the effect of segregation to stepped surfaces illustrating this with recent work on segregation of La3+ to CaF2 surfaces, which show enhanced segregation to step edges. We discuss next the application of lattice dynamics to modelling point defects in complex oxide materials by applying this to the study of hydrogen incorporation into {$\beta$}-Mg2SiO4. Finally our attention is turned to a method for considering the surface energy of physically defective surfaces and we illustrate its approach by considering the low index surfaces of {$\alpha$}-Al2O3.},

PyDEF is particularly suited for semiconductor materials as it includes finite size error corrections due to spurious intercell interactions as it is able to plot the formation energy of the different charge states and to determine the more stable ones as a function of the Fermi energy. Moreover PyDEF is able to plot Density Of States (DOS) with various parameters such as the projection on atoms or atomic species allowing a more comprehensive representation of defect-related electronic states. This software is developed in such a way that even non specialist or coder can use it and easily and quickly obtain reliable results.}

Despite notable developments over the past decade, the light-to-electricity conversion efficiency of Sb2Se3 has reached a plateau of {\textasciitilde}10\%. Is this an intrinsic limitation of the material or is there scope to rival the success of metal halide perovskite solar cells? Here we assess the trap-limited conversion efficiency of Sb2Se3. First-principles defect analysis of the hole and electron capture rates for point defects demonstrates the critical role of vacancies as active recombination centres. We predict an upper limit of 25\% efficiency in Sb2Se3 grown under optimal equilibrium conditions where the concentrations of charged vacancies are minimised. We further reveal how the detrimental effect of Se vacancies can be reduced by extrinsic oxygen passivation, highlighting a pathway to achieve high-performance metal selenide solar cells close to the thermodynamic limit.},
