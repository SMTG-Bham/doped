``doped`` is a python package for managing solid-state defect calculations, with functionality to
generate defect structures and relevant competing phases (for chemical potentials), interface with `ShakeNBreak`_ for defect structure-searching, write VASP input files for defect supercell calculations, and automatically parse and analyse the results.

Tutorials showing the code functionality and usage are provided on the `docs`_ site.

Installation
--------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install doped  # install doped and dependencies

Alternatively if desired, `doped` can also be installed from `conda` with:

.. code-block:: bash

   conda install -c conda-forge doped

Setup `POTCAR`s and `Materials Project` API
--------------------------------------------

To generate `VASP` `POTCAR` input files, and auto-determine `INCAR` settings such as `NELECT` for charged defects, your `POTCAR` directory needs to be setup to work with `pymatgen` (via the `.pmgrc.yaml` file).

**Instructions:**

#.

   - Set the VASP pseudopotential directory and your Materials Project API key in ``$HOME/.pmgrc.yaml`` (`pymatgen` config file) as follows:

     .. code-block:: bash

        PMG_VASP_PSP_DIR: <Path to VASP pseudopotential top directory>
        PMG_MAPI_KEY: <Your MP API key obtained from https://legacy.materialsproject.org/open>

    #. [The rest of your instructions go here.]

`ShakeNBreak`
---------------

As shown in the example notebook, it is highly recommended to use the `ShakeNBreak`_ approach when calculating point defects in solids. [Truncated for brevity.]

Requirements
