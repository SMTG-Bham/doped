  ICORELEVEL: "0  # Needed if using the Kumagai-Oba (eFNV) anisotropic charge correction scheme"
  ISIF: 2  # Fixed supercell for defects
  ISPIN: 2  # Spin polarisation likely for defects

# Note that EDIFF is also scaled according to the number of atoms in the supercell,
# and NUPDOWN is set to 0 or 1 depending on the number of electrons (even/odd).
# and KPAR is set to 2 `vasp_std` calculations (multiple kpoints)
