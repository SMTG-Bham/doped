    Generates INCAR, POTCAR and KPOINTS for `vasp_ncl` (i.e. spin-orbit coupling (SOC)) defect
    supercell singlepoint calculations. By default does not generate POSCAR (input structure)
    files, as these should be taken from `vasp_std` relaxations (i.e.
    `cp vasp_std/CONTCAR vasp_ncl/POSCAR`), which themselves likely originated from `ShakeNBreak`
    calculations (via `snb-groundstate`). See the `HSE06_RelaxSet.yaml` and `DefectSet.yaml`
    files in the `doped` folder for the default `INCAR` settings, and `PotcarSet.yaml` for the
    default `POTCAR` settings.

    Note that any changes to the default `INCAR`/`POTCAR` settings should be consistent with
    those used for competing phase (chemical potential) calculations.

    Args:
        defect_dict (dict):
            Dictionary of defects to generate VASP input files for. Should match the output
            format of the `defects` attribute of `ChargedDefectsStructures` (as shown in the
            `dope_workflow_example` notebook) â€“ i.e. {"substitutions": [list of substitution
            defects], "interstitials":...}, or a single defect subdict of this â€“ i.e. {"name":
            "vac_1_Se", "supercell":...}.
        output_dir (str):
            Folder in which to create the VASP defect calculation inputs folders. Default is the
            current directory.
        subfolder (str):
            Output folder structure is `<defect_species>/<subfolder>` where `subfolder` =
            'vasp_ncl' by default. Setting `subfolder` to `None` will write the vasp_ncl input
            files directly to the `<defect_species>` folder, with no subfolders created.
        user_incar_settings (dict):
            Dictionary of user INCAR settings (AEXX, NCORE etc.) to override default settings.
            Highly recommended to look at output INCARs or doped.vasp_input
            source code, to see what the default INCAR settings are. Note that any flags that
            aren't numbers or True/False need to be input as strings with quotation marks
            (e.g. `{"ALGO": "All"}`).
            (default: None)
        user_kpoints_settings (dict or Kpoints):
            Dictionary of user KPOINTS settings (in pymatgen DictSet() format) e.g.,
            {"reciprocal_density": 1000}, or a Kpoints object. Default KPOINTS is a Gamma-centred
            2 x 2 x 2 mesh.
            (default: None)
        user_potcar_functional (str): POTCAR functional to use (default = "PBE_54")
        user_potcar_settings (dict): Override the default POTCARs, e.g. {"Li": "Li_sv"}. See
            `doped/PotcarSet.yaml` for the default `POTCAR` set.
        unperturbed_poscar (bool):
            If True, write the unperturbed defect POSCARs to the generated folders as well. Not
            recommended, as the recommended workflow is to initially perform vasp_gam
            ground-state structure searching using ShakeNBreak (see example notebook;
            https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io), then continue the vasp_std relaxations from the
            'Groundstate' CONTCARs, before doing final vasp_ncl singleshot calculations if SOC is
            important.
            (default: False)
        write_files (bool): Whether to write the VASP input files to disk. Default is True.

    Returns:
        Dictionary of {defect_species: `DefectRelaxSet`} for each defect species in the input
        defect_dict. `DefectRelaxSet` is a subclass of `pymatgen`'s `DictSet` class,
        with `incar`, `poscar` (unperturbed), `kpoints` and `potcar` attributes, containing
        information on the generated files.
