@dataclass
class DefectEntry(thermo.DefectEntry):
    """
    Subclass of ``pymatgen.analysis.defects.thermo.DefectEntry`` with
    additional attributes used by ``doped``.

    Core Attributes:
        defect:
            ``doped``/``pymatgen`` defect object corresponding to the defect in the entry.
        charge_state:
            Charge state of the defect.
        sc_entry:
            ``pymatgen`` ``ComputedStructureEntry`` for the `defect` supercell.
        sc_defect_frac_coords:
            The fractional coordinates of the defect in the supercell.
        bulk_entry:
            ``pymatgen`` ``ComputedEntry`` for the bulk supercell reference. Required
            for calculating the defect formation energy.
        corrections:
            A dictionary of energy corrections which are summed and added to
            the defect formation energy.
        corrections_metadata:
            A dictionary that acts as a generic container for storing information
            about how the corrections were calculated. Only used for debugging
            and plotting purposes.

    Parsing Attributes:
        calculation_metadata:
            A dictionary of calculation parameters and data, used to perform
            charge corrections and compute formation energies.
        degeneracy_factors:
            A dictionary of degeneracy factors contributing to the total degeneracy
            of the defect species (such as spin and configurational degeneracy etc).
            This is an important factor in the defect concentration equation (see
            discussion in https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00043A and
            https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E), and so affects the output of the
            defect concentration / Fermi level functions. This can be edited by the
            user if the ``doped`` defaults are not appropriate (e.g. ``doped`` assumes
            singlet (S=0) state for even-electron defects and doublet (S=1/2) state
            for odd-electron defects, which is typically the case but can have
            triplets (S=1) or other multiplets for e.g. bipolarons, quantum /
            d-orbital / magnetic defects etc.); see
            https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tips.html#spin-polarisation for
            discussion.

    Generation Attributes:
        name:
            The ``doped``-generated name of the defect entry. See docstrings
            of ``DefectsGenerator`` for the doped naming algorithm.
        conventional_structure:
            Conventional cell structure of the host according to the Bilbao
            Crystallographic Server (BCS) definition, used to determine defect
            site Wyckoff labels and multiplicities.
        conv_cell_frac_coords:
            Fractional coordinates of the defect in the conventional cell.
        equiv_conv_cell_frac_coords:
            Symmetry-equivalent defect positions in fractional coordinates of
            the conventional cell.
        _BilbaoCS_conv_cell_vector_mapping:
            A vector mapping the lattice vectors of the ``spglib``-defined
            conventional cell to that of the Bilbao Crystallographic Server
            definition (for most space groups the definitions are the same).
        wyckoff:
            Wyckoff label of the defect site.
        charge_state_guessing_log:
            A log of the input & computed values used to determine charge state
            probabilities.
        defect_supercell:
            ``pymatgen`` ``Structure`` object of the defect supercell.
        defect_supercell_site:
            ``pymatgen`` ``PeriodicSite`` object of the defect in the defect supercell.
        equivalent_supercell_sites:
            List of ``pymatgen`` ``PeriodicSite`` objects of symmetry-equivalent defect
            sites in the defect supercell.

        ``defect_region_radius`` works perfectly well. However, for certain materials
        at small/intermediate supercell sizes, you may want to adjust this (and/or
        ``excluded_indices``) to ensure the best sampling of the plateau region away
        from the defect position - ``doped`` should throw a warning in these cases
        (about the correction error being above the default tolerance (50 meV)).
        For example, with layered materials, the defect charge is often localised
        to one layer, so we may want to adjust ``defect_region_radius`` and/or
        ``excluded_indices`` to ensure that only sites in other layers are used for
        the sampling region (plateau) - see example on doped docs ``Tips`` page.

        The correction error is estimated by computing the standard error of the mean
        of the sampled site potential differences, multiplied by the defect charge.
        This is expected to be a lower bound estimate of the true charge correction
        error.

        Args:
            dielectric (float or int or 3x1 matrix or 3x3 matrix):
                Total dielectric constant of the host compound (including both
                ionic and (high-frequency) electronic contributions), in the
                same xyz Cartesian basis as the supercell calculations. If None,
                then the dielectric constant is taken from the ``defect_entry``
                ``calculation_metadata`` if available.
            defect_region_radius (float):
                Radius of the defect region (in Å). Sites outside the defect
                region are used for sampling the electrostatic potential far
                from the defect (to obtain the potential alignment).
                If None (default), uses the Wigner-Seitz radius of the supercell.
            excluded_indices (list):
                List of site indices (in the defect supercell) to exclude from
                the site potential sampling in the correction calculation/plot.
                If None (default), no sites are excluded.
            defect_outcar (str or Outcar):
                Path to the output VASP OUTCAR file from the defect supercell
                calculation, or the corresponding ``pymatgen`` Outcar object.
                If None, will try to use the ``defect_supercell_site_potentials``
                from the ``defect_entry`` ``calculation_metadata`` if available.
            bulk_outcar (str or Outcar):
                Path to the output VASP OUTCAR file from the bulk supercell
                calculation, or the corresponding ``pymatgen`` Outcar object.
                If None, will try to use the ``bulk_supercell_site_potentials``
                from the ``defect_entry`` ``calculation_metadata`` if available.
            plot (bool):
                Whether to plot the Kumagai site potential plots (for
                manually checking the behaviour of the charge correction here).
            filename (str):
                Filename to save the Kumagai site potential plots to.
                If None, plots are not saved.
            return_correction_error (bool):
                If True, also returns the standard error of the mean of the
                sampled site potential differences times the defect charge
                (which gives an estimate of the error range of the correction
                energy). Default is False.
            error_tolerance (float):
                If the estimated error in the charge correction, based on the
                variance of the potential in the sampling region, is greater than
                this value (in eV), then a warning is raised. (default: 0.05 eV)
            style_file (str):
                Path to a ``.mplstyle`` file to use for the plot. If ``None``
                (default), uses the default doped style
                (from ``doped/utils/doped.mplstyle``).
            **kwargs:
                Additional kwargs to pass to
                pydefect.corrections.efnv_correction.ExtendedFnvCorrection
                (e.g. charge, defect_region_radius, defect_coords).

        Returns:
            CorrectionResults (summary of the corrections applied and metadata), and
            the matplotlib figure object if ``plot`` is True, and the estimated charge
            correction error if ``return_correction_error`` is True.

        fractional coordinates in the supercell, while keeping the supercell
        fixed (to avoid any issues with defect parsing).
        Also returns information about equivalent defect sites in the supercell.

                supercell matrix (i.e. a diagonal expansion of the primitive or
