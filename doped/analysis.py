        A class for rapidly parsing multiple VASP defect supercell calculations
        for a given host (bulk) material.

        Loops over calculation directories in ``output_path`` (likely the same
        ``output_path`` used with ``DefectsSet`` for file generation in ``doped.vasp``)
        and parses the defect calculations into a dictionary of:
        ``{defect_name: DefectEntry}``, where the ``defect_name`` is set to the defect
        calculation folder name (`if it is a recognised defect name`), else it is
        set to the default ``doped`` name for that defect. By default, searches for
        folders in ``output_path`` with ``subfolder`` containing ``vasprun.xml(.gz)``
        files, and tries to parse them as ``DefectEntry``\s.

        By default, tries to use multiprocessing to speed up defect parsing, which
        can be controlled with ``processes``. If parsing hangs, this may be due to
        memory issues, in which case you should reduce ``processes`` (e.g. 4 or less).

        Defect charge states are automatically determined from the defect calculation
        outputs if ``POTCAR``\s are set up with ``pymatgen`` (see docs Installation page),
        or if that fails, using the defect folder name (must end in "_+X" or "_-X"
        where +/-X is the defect charge state).

        Uses the (single) ``DefectParser`` class to parse the individual defect
        calculations. Note that the bulk and defect supercells should have the same
        definitions/basis sets (for site-matching and finite-size charge corrections
        to work appropriately).

                file generation in ``doped.vasp``). Default = current directory.

                Ionic + static contributions to the dielectric constant, in the same xyz
                Cartesian basis as the supercell calculations. If not provided, charge
                corrections cannot be computed and so ``skip_corrections`` will be set to

            subfolder (str):
                Name of subfolder(s) within each defect calculation folder (in the

                parse (e.g. ``vasp_ncl``, ``vasp_std``, ``vasp_gam`` etc.). If not
                specified, ``doped`` checks first for ``vasp_ncl``, ``vasp_std``, ``vasp_gam``
                subfolders with calculation outputs (``vasprun.xml(.gz)`` files) and uses
                the highest level VASP type (ncl > std > gam) found as ``subfolder``,
                otherwise uses the defect calculation folder itself with no subfolder
                (set ``subfolder = "."`` to enforce this).
            bulk_path (str):
                Path to bulk supercell reference calculation folder. If not specified,
                searches for folder with name "X_bulk" in the ``output_path`` directory
                (matching the default ``doped`` name for the bulk supercell reference folder).
            skip_corrections (bool):
                Whether to skip the calculation and application of finite-size charge
                corrections to the defect energies (not recommended in most cases).
                Default = False.
            error_tolerance (float):
                If the estimated error in any charge correction is greater than
                this value (in eV), then a warning is raised. (default: 0.05 eV)
            bulk_band_gap_path (str):
                Path to bulk OUTCAR file for determining the band gap. If the VBM/CBM
                occur at reciprocal space points not included in the bulk supercell
                calculation, you should use this tag to point to a bulk bandstructure
                calculation instead. Alternatively, you can edit/add the "gap" and "vbm"
                entries in DefectParser.defect_entry.calculation_metadata to match the
                correct (eigen)values.
                If None, will calculate "gap"/"vbm" using the outputs at:
                DefectParser.defect_entry.calculation_metadata["bulk_path"]
            processes (int):
                Number of processes to use for multiprocessing for expedited parsing.
                If not set, defaults to one less than the number of CPUs available.
            json_filename (str):
                Filename to save the parsed defect entries dict (``DefectsParser.defect_dict``)
                to in ``output_path``, to avoid having to re-parse defects when later analysing
                further and aiding calculation provenance. Can be reloaded using the ``loadfn``
                function from ``monty.serialization`` (and then input to ``DefectThermodynamics``
                etc). If None (default), set as "{Chemical Formula}_defect_dict.json" where
                {Chemical Formula} is the chemical formula of the host material.
                If False, no json file is saved.

        Attributes:
            defect_dict (dict):
                Dictionary of parsed defect calculations in the format:
                ``{"defect_name": DefectEntry}`` where the defect_name is set to the
                defect calculation folder name (`if it is a recognised defect name`),
                else it is set to the default ``doped`` name for that defect.

        objects in self.defect_dict, which can then be used to analyse and plot

                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect
                formation energies. This can have the form of
                ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}]}`` (the format generated by
                ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing functions (see tutorials)) which
                allows easy analysis over a range of chemical potentials - where limit(s)
                (chemical potential limit(s)) to analyse/plot can later be chosen using
                the ``limits`` argument.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (limit), in the format: ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases
                in order to show the formal (relative) chemical potentials above the
                formation energy plot, in which case it is the formal chemical potentials
                (i.e. relative to the elemental references) that should be given here,
                otherwise the absolute (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.

                If None (default), sets all chemical potentials to zero. Chemical
                potentials can also be supplied later in each analysis function.

                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``). Unnecessary if ``chempots`` is

            vbm (float):
                VBM energy to use as Fermi level reference point for analysis.

                dict attributes of the parsed DefectEntry objects.

                Band gap of the host, to use for analysis.

                dict attributes of the parsed DefectEntry objects.
            dist_tol (float):
                Threshold for the closest distance (in Å) between equivalent
                defect sites, for different species of the same defect type,
                to be grouped together (for plotting and transition level
                analysis). If the minimum distance between equivalent defect
                sites is less than ``dist_tol``, then they will be grouped
                together, otherwise treated as separate defects.
                (Default: 1.5)
            check_compatibility (bool):
                Whether to check the compatibility of the bulk entry for each defect
                entry (i.e. that all reference bulk energies are the same).
