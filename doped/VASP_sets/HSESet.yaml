  AEXX: 0.25  # HSE06 assumed by default. Set AEXX in INCAR config settings to tune alpha xc parameter.
  HFSCREEN: 0.208  # correct HSE screening parameter; see https://aip.scitation.org/doi/10.1063/1.2404663
  # Note this HFSCREEN value differs from the Materials Project MPHSERelaxSet default of 0.2! This should
  # be consistent between all your defect/bulk/competing-phase calculations. Change to 0 for PBE0.
  LHFCALC: true
