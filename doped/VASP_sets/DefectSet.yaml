INCAR:
  EDIFF: 1e-5  # fixed EDIFF for defect calculations
  ICORELEVEL: "0  # Needed if using the Kumagai-Oba (eFNV) anisotropic charge correction scheme"
  ISIF: 2  # Fixed supercell for defects
  ISPIN: '2  # Spin polarisation likely for defects'
  ISYM: '0  # Symmetry breaking extremely likely for defects'
  LVHAR: "True  # Needed if using the Freysoldt (FNV) charge correction scheme"
  NSW: 200  # increase NSW for defect calculations

# Notes:
# KPAR is set to 2 for `vasp_std` calculations (multiple kpoints)
# NUPDOWN is set to 0 (singlet) or 1 (doublet) depending on the number of electrons
# (even or odd, respectively) -- see https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tips.html#magnetization
