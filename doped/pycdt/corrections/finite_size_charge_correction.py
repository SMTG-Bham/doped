"""
This module contains calls to finite size supercell charge corrections as
implemented in pymatgen.analysis.defects.core

The methods implemented are
1) Freysoldt correction for isotropic systems. Includes:
       a) PC energy
       b) potential alignment by planar averaging.
2) Extended Freysoldt or Kumagai correction for anistropic systems. Includes:
       a) anisotropic PC energy
       b) potential alignment by atomic site averaging outside Wigner Seitz radius
3) Sxdefectalign wrapper - python interface to using robust C++ code written by
   Freysoldt et. al (in principle the results are identical to the output of our own
   Freysoldt python code)

If you use the corrections implemented in this module, cite
   Freysoldt, Neugebauer, and Van de Walle,
    Phys. Status Solidi B. 248, 1067-1076 (2011) for isotropic correction
   Kumagai and Oba, Phys. Rev. B. 89, 195205 (2014) for anisotropic correction
   in addition to the PyCDT paper
