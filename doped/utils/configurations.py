    Generate a series of interpolated structures along the linear path between

    Structures are output as a dictionary with keys corresponding to either
    the index of the interpolated structure (0-indexed; ``00``, ``01`` etc
    as for VASP NEB calculations) or the fractional displacement along the
    interpolation path between structures, and values corresponding to the
    interpolated structure. If ``displacements`` is set (and thus two sets
    of structures are generated), a tuple of such dictionaries is returned.

    Note that for NEB calculations, the the lattice vectors and order of
    sites (atomic indices) must be consistent in both ``struct1`` and
    ``struct2``. This can be ensured by using the ``orient_s2_like_s1()``
    function in ``doped.utils.configurations``, as shown in the ``doped``
    tutorials. This is also desirable for CC diagrams, as the atomic indices
    are assumed to match for many parsing and plotting functions (e.g. in
    ``nonrad`` and ``CarrierCapture.jl``), but is not strictly necessary.

    between two symmetry-equivalent sites), but have mis-matching orientations/
    positions (such that they do not correspond to the shortest linear path
    between them), a warning will be raised. See the ``doped`` configuration
    coordinate / NEB path generation tutorial for a deeper explanation.

    assuming a standard NEB/PES calculation is being performed). If

    Custom rounding function that rounds the input number(s) to the lowest
    number of decimals which gives the same numerical value as the input, to
    within a specified tolerance value.

    For example, 0.5000001 with tol = 1e-5 (default) would be
    rounded to 0.5, but 0.5780001 would be rounded to 0.578.

    Primary use case is for rounding float values returned by
    ``numpy`` which may be e.g. 0.50000001 instead of 0.5.

    If a list or array of numbers is provided (rather than a single
    float), then rounding is applied to each element in the
    list/array. If ``consistent_decimals=True`` (default), then the
    same number of decimals is used for rounding for all elements,
    where this number of decimals is the minimum required for
    rounding to satisfy the tolerance for all elements.

    Args:
        numbers (float, list[float], np.ndarray[float]):
            The number(s) to round.
        tol (float): The tolerance value for rounding.
            Default: ``1e-5``
        return_decimals (bool):
            If ``True``, also returns the identified appropriate
            number of decimals to round to. Default: ``False``.
        consistent_decimals (bool):
            If ``True``, the same number of decimals is used for
            rounding for all elements in the input list/array,
            where this number of decimals is the minimum required
            for rounding to satisfy the tolerance for all elements.
            Default: ``True``

    Returns:
        Union[float, list[float], np.ndarray[float]]:
            The rounded number(s). If ``return_decimals=True``, then
            a tuple is returned with the rounded number(s) and the

    Generate a series of interpolated structures along the linear path between
    ``struct1`` and ``struct2``, typically for use in NEB calculations or
    configuration coordinate (CC) diagrams, and write to folders.

    Folder names are labelled by the index of the interpolated structure
    (0-indexed; ``00``, ``01`` etc as for VASP NEB calculations) or the
    fractional displacement along the interpolation path between structures
    (e.g. ``delQ_0.0``, ``delQ_0.1``, ``delQ_-0.1`` etc), depending on
    the input ``n_images``/``displacements`` settings.

    Note that for NEB calculations, the the lattice vectors and order of
    sites (atomic indices) must be consistent in both ``struct1`` and
    ``struct2``. This can be ensured by using the ``orient_s2_like_s1()``
    function in ``doped.utils.configurations``, as shown in the ``doped``
    tutorials. This is also desirable for CC diagrams, as the atomic indices
    are assumed to match for many parsing and plotting functions (e.g. in
    ``nonrad`` and ``CarrierCapture.jl``), but is not strictly necessary.
    If the input structures are detected to be different
    (symmetry-inequivalent) geometries (e.g. not a simple defect migration
    between two symmetry-equivalent sites), but have mis-matching orientations/
    positions (such that they do not correspond to the shortest linear path
    between them), a warning will be raised. See the ``doped`` configuration
    coordinate / NEB path generation tutorial for a deeper explanation.
    (TODO)

    If only ``n_images`` is set (and ``displacements`` is ``None``)(default),
    then only one set of interpolated structures is written (in other words,
    assuming a standard NEB/PES calculation is being performed). If
    ``displacements`` (and possibly ``displacements2``) is set, then two sets
    of interpolated structures are written (in other words, assuming a CC /
    non-radiative recombination calculation is being performed, where the two
    sets of structures are to be calculated in separate charge/spin etc states).

    Args:
        struct1 (Structure): Initial structure.
        struct2 (Structure): Final structure.
        output_dir (PathLike):
            Directory to write the interpolated structures to.
            Defaults to "Configuration_Coordinate" if ``displacements`` is set,
            otherwise "NEB".
        n_images (int):
            Number of images to interpolate between ``struct1`` and ``struct2``,
            or a list of fractiional interpolation values (displacements) to use.
            Note that ``n_images`` is ignored if ``displacements`` is set (in
            which case CC / non-radiative recombination calculations are
            assumed, otherwise a standard NEB / PES calculation is assumed).
            Default: 7
        displacements (np.ndarray or list):
            Displacements to use for ``struct1`` along the linear transformation
            path to ``struct2``. If set, then CC / non-radiative recombination
            calculations are assumed, and two sets of interpolated structures
            will be written to file. If set and ``displacements2`` is not set,
            then the same set of displacements is used for both sets of
            interpolated structures. Default: ``None``
        displacements2 (np.ndarray or list):
            Displacements to use for ``struct2`` along the linear transformation
            path to ``struct1``. If not set and ``displacements`` is not ``None``,
            then the same set of displacements is used for both sets of
