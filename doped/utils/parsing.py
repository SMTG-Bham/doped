    Get the combined site and orientational degeneracy of an interstitial
    defect entry.

    The standard approach of using ``_get_equiv_sites()`` for interstitial
    site multiplicity and then ``point_symmetry_from_defect_entry()`` &
    ``get_orientational_degeneracy`` for symmetry/orientational degeneracy
    is preferred (as used in the ``DefectParser`` code), but alternatively
    this function can be used to compute the product of the site and
    orientational degeneracies.

    This is done by determining the number of equivalent sites in the bulk
    supercell for the given interstitial site (from defect_supercell_site),
    which gives the combined site and orientational degeneracy `if` there
    was no relaxation of the bulk lattice atoms. This matches the true
    combined degeneracy in most cases, except for split-interstitial type
    defects etc, where this would give an artificially high degeneracy
    (as, for example, the interstitial site is automatically assigned to
    one of the split-interstitial atoms and not the midpoint, giving a
    doubled degeneracy as it considers the two split-interstitial sites as
    two separate (degenerate) interstitial sites, instead of one).
    This is counteracted by dividing by the number of sites which are present
    in the defect supercell (within a distance tolerance of dist_tol in Å)
    with the same species, ensuring none of the predicted `different`
    equivalent sites are actually `included` in the defect structure.

    Get the orientational degeneracy factor for a given `relaxed` DefectEntry,
    by supplying either the DefectEntry object or the bulk-site & relaxed
    defect point group symbols (e.g. "Td", "C3v" etc).

    If a DefectEntry is supplied (and the point group symbols are not),
    this is computed by determining the `relaxed` defect point symmetry and the
    (unrelaxed) bulk site symmetry, and then getting the ratio of
    their point group orders (equivalent to the ratio of partition
    functions or number of symmetry operations (i.e. degeneracy)).

    For interstitials, the bulk site symmetry corresponds to the
    point symmetry of the interstitial site with `no relaxation
    of the host structure`, while for vacancies/substitutions it is
    simply the symmetry of their corresponding bulk site.
    This corresponds to the point symmetry of ``DefectEntry.defect``,
    or ``calculation_metadata["bulk_site"]/["unrelaxed_defect_structure"]``.

    Note: This tries to use the defect_entry.defect_supercell to determine
    the `relaxed` site symmetry. However, it should be noted that this is not
    guaranteed to work in all cases; namely for non-diagonal supercell
    expansions, or sometimes for non-scalar supercell expansion matrices
    (e.g. a 2x1x2 expansion)(particularly with high-symmetry materials)
    which can mess up the periodicity of the cell. ``doped`` tries to automatically
    check if this is the case, and will warn you if so.

    This can also be checked by using this function on your doped `generated` defects:

    .. code-block:: python

        from doped.generation import get_defect_name_from_entry
        for defect_name, defect_entry in defect_gen.items():
            print(defect_name, get_defect_name_from_entry(defect_entry, relaxed=False),
                  get_defect_name_from_entry(defect_entry), "\n")

    And if the point symmetries match in each case, then using this function on your
    parsed `relaxed` DefectEntry objects should correctly determine the final relaxed
    defect symmetry (and orientational degeneracy) - otherwise periodicity-breaking
    prevents this.

    If periodicity-breaking prevents auto-symmetry determination, you can manually
    determine the relaxed defect and bulk-site point symmetries, and/or orientational
    degeneracy, from visualising the structures (e.g. using VESTA)(can use
    ``get_orientational_degeneracy`` to obtain the corresponding orientational
    degeneracy factor for given defect/bulk-site point symmetries) and setting the
    corresponding values in the
    ``calculation_metadata['relaxed point symmetry']/['bulk site symmetry']`` and/or
    ``degeneracy_factors['orientational degeneracy']`` attributes.
    Note that the bulk-site point symmetry corresponds to that of ``DefectEntry.defect``,
    or equivalently ``calculation_metadata["bulk_site"]/["unrelaxed_defect_structure"]``,
    which for vacancies/substitutions is the symmetry of the corresponding bulk site,
    while for interstitials it is the point symmetry of the `final relaxed` interstitial
    site when placed in the (unrelaxed) bulk structure.
    The degeneracy factor is used in the calculation of defect/carrier concentrations
    and Fermi level behaviour (see e.g. doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00043A &
    doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E).

            symmetry label from ``doped`` when generating the defect, while for
            interstitials it should be the point symmetry of the `final relaxed`

            Symmetry tolerance for spglib. Default is 0.2, which is larger than
            that used for only unrelaxed structures in doped (0.01), to account for
            residual structural noise in relaxed supercells. You may want to adjust
            for your system (e.g. if there are very slight octahedral distortions etc).
        defect_type (DefectType or str):

            Interstitial/"interstitial") to check if the output orientational
