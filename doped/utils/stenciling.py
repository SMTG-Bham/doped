    """
    Re-generate a relaxed defect structure in a different supercell.

    This function takes the relaxed defect structure of the input ``DefectEntry``
    (from ``DefectEntry.defect_supercell``) and re-generates it in the
    ``target_supercell`` structure, and the closest possible position to
    ``target_frac_coords`` (if provided, else closest to centre = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]).

    Briefly, this function works by:

    - Translating the defect site to the centre of the original supercell.
    - Identifying a super-supercell which fully encompasses the target supercell
      (regardless of orientation).
    - Generate this super-supercell, using one copy of the original defect
      supercell (``DefectEntry.defect_supercell``), and the rest of the sites
      (outside of the original defect supercell box, with the defect translated
      to the centre) are populated using the bulk supercell
      (``DefectEntry.bulk_supercell``).
    - Translate the defect site in this super-supercell to the Cartesian coordinates
      of the centre of ``target_supercell``, then stencil out all sites in the
      ``target_supercell`` portion of the super-supercell, accounting for possible
      site displacements in the relaxed defect supercell (e.g. if ``target_supercell``
      has a different shape and does not fully encompass the original defect
      supercell).
      This is done by scanning over possible combinations of sites near the boundary
      regions of the ``target_supercell`` portion, and identifying the combination
      which maximises the minimum inter-atomic distance in the new supercell (i.e. the
      most bulk-like arrangement).
    - Re-orient this new stenciled supercell to match the orientation and site
      positions of ``target_supercell``.
    - If ``target_frac_coords`` is not ``False``, scan over all symmetry operations
      of ``target_supercell`` and apply that which places the defect site closest
      to ``target_frac_coords``.

    Args:
        defect_entry (DefectEntry):
            A ``DefectEntry`` object for which to re-generate the relaxed
            structure (taken from ``DefectEntry.defect_supercell``) in the
            ``target_supercell`` lattice.
        target_supercell (Structure):
            The supercell structure to re-generate the relaxed defect
            structure in.
        target_frac_coords (Union[np.ndarray[float], list[float], bool]):
            The fractional coordinates to target for defect placement in the
            new supercell. If just set to ``True`` (default), will try to place
            the defect nearest to the centre of the superset cell (i.e.
            ``target_frac_coords = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]``), as is default in ``doped``
            defect generation. Note that defect placement is harder in this
            case than in generation with ``DefectsGenerator``, as we are not
            starting from primitive cells and we are working with relaxed
            geometries.
        edge_tol (float):
            A tolerance (in Angstrom) for site displacements at the edge of the
            ``target_supercell`` supercell, when determining the best match of
            sites to stencil out in the new supercell.
            Default is 1 Angstrom, and then this is sequentially increased up
            to 4.5 Angstrom if the initial scan fails.

    Returns:
        Structure: The relaxed defect structure in the new supercell.
