    """
    Re-generate a relaxed defect structure in a different supercell.

    This function takes the relaxed defect structure of the input ``DefectEntry``
    (from ``DefectEntry.defect_supercell``) and re-generates it in the
    ``target_supercell`` structure, and the closest possible position to
    ``target_frac_coords`` (if provided, else closest to centre = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]),
    also providing the corresponding bulk supercell (which should be the same for
    each generated defect supercell given the same ``target_supercell`` and base
    supercell for ``defect_entry``, see note below).

    ``target_supercell`` should be the same host crystal structure, just with
    different supercell dimensions, having the same lattice parameters and bond
    lengths.

    Note: This function does _not_ guarantee that the generated defect supercell
    atomic position basis exactly matches that of ``target_supercell``, which may
    have come from a different primitive structure definition (e.g. CdTe with
    ``{"Cd": [0,0,0], "Te": [0.25,0.25,0.25]}`` vs
    ``{"Cd": [0,0,0], "Te": [0.75,0.75,0.75]}``). The generated supercell _will_
    have the exact same lattice/cell definition with fully symmetry-equivalent atom
    positions, but if the actual position basis differs then this can cause issues
    with parsing finite-size corrections (which rely on site-matched potentials).
    This is perfectly fine if it occurs, just will require the use of a matching
    bulk/reference supercell when parsing (rather than the input ``target_supercell``)
    -- ``doped`` will also throw a warning about this when parsing if a non-matching
    bulk supercell is used anyway.
    This function will automatically check if the position basis in the generated
    supercell differs from that of ``target_supercell``, printing a warning if so
    (unless ``check_bulk`` is ``False``) and returning the corresponding bulk
    supercell which should be used for parsing defect calculations with the
    generated supercell. Of course, if generating multiple defects in the same
    ``target_supercell``, only one such bulk supercell calculation should be required
    (should correspond to the same bulk supercell in each case).

    Briefly, this function works by:

    - Translating the defect site to the centre of the original supercell.
    - Identifying a super-supercell which fully encompasses the target supercell
      (regardless of orientation).
    - Generate this super-supercell, using one copy of the original defect
      supercell (``DefectEntry.defect_supercell``), and the rest of the sites
      (outside of the original defect supercell box, with the defect translated
      to the centre) are populated using the bulk supercell
      (``DefectEntry.bulk_supercell``).
    - Translate the defect site in this super-supercell to the Cartesian coordinates
      of the centre of ``target_supercell``, then stencil out all sites in the
      ``target_supercell`` portion of the super-supercell, accounting for possible
      site displacements in the relaxed defect supercell (e.g. if ``target_supercell``
      has a different shape and does not fully encompass the original defect
      supercell).
      This is done by scanning over possible combinations of sites near the boundary
      regions of the ``target_supercell`` portion, and identifying the combination
      which maximises the minimum inter-atomic distance in the new supercell (i.e. the
      most bulk-like arrangement).
    - Re-orient this new stenciled supercell to match the orientation and site
      positions of ``target_supercell``.
    - If ``target_frac_coords`` is not ``False``, scan over all symmetry operations
      of ``target_supercell`` and apply that which places the defect site closest
      to ``target_frac_coords``.

    Args:
        defect_entry (DefectEntry):
            A ``DefectEntry`` object for which to re-generate the relaxed
            structure (taken from ``DefectEntry.defect_supercell``) in the
            ``target_supercell`` lattice.
        target_supercell (Structure):
            The supercell structure to re-generate the relaxed defect
            structure in.
        check_bulk (bool):
            Whether to check if the generated defect/bulk supercells have
            different atomic position bases to ``target_supercell`` (as described
            above) -- if so, a warning will be printed (unless ``check_bulk`` is
            ``False``). Default is ``True``.
        target_frac_coords (Union[np.ndarray[float], list[float], bool]):
            The fractional coordinates to target for defect placement in the
            new supercell. If just set to ``True`` (default), will try to place
            the defect nearest to the centre of the superset cell (i.e.
            ``target_frac_coords = [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]``), as is default in ``doped``
            defect generation. Note that defect placement is harder in this
            case than in generation with ``DefectsGenerator``, as we are not
            starting from primitive cells and we are working with relaxed
            geometries.
        edge_tol (float):
            A tolerance (in Angstrom) for site displacements at the edge of the
            stenciled supercell, when determining the best match of
            sites to stencil out in the new supercell (of ``target_supercell``
            dimension). Default is 1 Angstrom, and then this is sequentially
            increased up to 4.5 Angstrom if the initial scan fails.

    Returns:
        tuple[Structure, Structure]:
            The re-generated defect supercell in the ``target_supercell`` lattice,
            and the corresponding bulk/reference supercell for the generated defect
            supercell (see explanations above).

    Given the input ``big_supercell`` and ``target_supercell`` (which should be

    (i.e. are within the Cartesian bounds of ``target_supercell``).

    ``target_supercell`` and ``big_supercell`` are then aligned within this

    We need to ensure the appropriate number of sites (and their composition) are
    taken, and that the sites we choose are appropriate for the new supercell (i.e.
    that if we have e.g. an in-plane contraction, we don't take duplicate atoms
    that then correspond to tiny inter-atomic distances in the new supercell due to
    imperfect stenciling under PBC -- so we can't simply take the atoms that are
    closest to the defect). So, here we scan over possible choices of atoms to
    include, and take the combination which maximises the _minimum_ inter-atomic
    distance in the new supercell, when accounting for PBCs.
