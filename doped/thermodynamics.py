    """
    Class for analysing the calculated thermodynamics of defects in solids.
    Similar to a ``pymatgen`` ``PhaseDiagram`` object, allowing the analysis of
    formation energies as functions of Fermi level and chemical potentials
    (i.e. defect formation energy / transition level diagrams), charge
    transition levels, defect/carrier concentrations as functions of
    temperature, chemical potential etc.

    This class can be used to return:
        a) defect formation energy diagrams (plots),
        b) stability of charge states for a given defect,
        c) tables of all formation energies / symmetries & degeneracies,
        d) tables of equilibrium and constrained defect/carrier concentrations,
        e) charge transition levels, including metastable states,
        f) doping analysis,
        g) ...

    Note that ``DefectThermodynamics`` objects can be used to initialise the
    ``FermiSolver`` class in this module, which implements a number of
    convenience methods for thermodynamic analyses; such as scanning over
    temperatures, chemical potentials, effective dopant concentrations etc,
    minimising or maximising a target property (e.g. defect/carrier
    concentration), and also allowing greater control over constraints and
    approximations in defect concentration calculations; such as specifying
    (known) fixed concentrations of a defect/dopant, specifying defects to
    exclude from high-temperature concentration fixing in the frozen defect
    approximation (e.g. highly-mobile defects), and/or fixing defect charge
    states upon quenching.

        Create a ``DefectThermodynamics`` object, which can be used to analyse
        the calculated thermodynamics of defects in solids (formation energies,
        transition levels, concentrations etc).

        Usually initialised using ``DefectsParser.get_defect_thermodynamics()``, but
        can also be initialised with a list or dict of ``DefectEntry`` objects (e.g.
        from ``DefectsParser.defect_dict``).

        Note that the ``DefectEntry.name`` attributes are used to label the defects in
        plots.

        Args:
            defect_entries (dict[str, DefectEntry] or list[DefectEntry]):
                A dict or list of ``DefectEntry`` objects. Note that ``DefectEntry.name``
                attributes are used for grouping and plotting purposes! These should
                be in the format "{defect_name}_{optional_site_info}_{charge_state}".
                If the ``DefectEntry.name`` attribute is not defined or does not end with
                the charge state, then the entry will be renamed with the doped
                default name.
            chempots (dict):
                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect
                formation energies. This can have the form of
                ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}]}`` (the format generated by
                ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing functions (see tutorials)) which
                allows easy analysis over a range of chemical potentials - where limit(s)
                (chemical potential limit(s)) to analyse/plot can later be chosen using
                the ``limits`` argument.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (limit), in the format: ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases
                in order to show the formal (relative) chemical potentials above the
                formation energy plot, in which case it is the formal chemical potentials
                (i.e. relative to the elemental references) that should be given here,
                otherwise the absolute (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.

                If ``None`` (default), sets all chemical potentials to zero. Chemical
                potentials can also be supplied later in each analysis function, or set
                using ``DefectThermodynamics.chempots = ...`` (with the same input options).
            el_refs (dict):
                Dictionary of elemental reference energies for the chemical potentials
                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical
                potentials, when ``chempots`` has been manually specified as
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``). Unnecessary if ``chempots`` is
                provided in format generated by ``doped`` (see tutorials).

                If ``None`` (default), sets all elemental reference energies to zero. Reference
                energies can also be supplied later in each analysis function, or set
                using ``DefectThermodynamics.el_refs = ...`` (with the same input options).
            vbm (float):
                VBM eigenvalue to use as Fermi level reference point for analysis.
                If None (default), will use ``"vbm"`` from the ``calculation_metadata``
                dict attributes of the parsed ``DefectEntry`` objects, which by default
                is taken from the bulk supercell VBM (unless ``bulk_band_gap_vr`` is set
                during defect parsing).
                Note that ``vbm`` should only affect the reference for the Fermi level
                values output by ``doped`` (as this VBM eigenvalue is used as the zero
                reference), thus affecting the position of the band edges in the defect
                formation energy plots and doping window / dopability limit functions,
                and the reference of the reported Fermi levels.
            band_gap (float):
                Band gap of the host, to use for analysis.
                If ``None`` (default), will use "band_gap" from the calculation_metadata
                dict attributes of the DefectEntry objects in ``defect_entries``.
            dist_tol (float):
                Threshold for the closest distance (in Å) between equivalent
                defect sites, for different species of the same defect type,
                to be grouped together (for plotting, transition level analysis
                and defect concentration calculations). If the minimum distance between
                equivalent defect sites is less than ``dist_tol``, then they will be
                grouped together, otherwise treated as separate defects.
                See ``plot()`` and ``get_fermi_level_and_concentrations()`` docstrings
                for more information.
                (Default: 1.5)
            check_compatibility (bool):
                Whether to check the compatibility of the bulk entry for each defect
                entry (i.e. that all reference bulk energies are the same).
                (Default: True)
            bulk_dos (FermiDos or Vasprun or PathLike):
                ``pymatgen`` ``FermiDos`` for the bulk electronic density of states (DOS),
                for calculating Fermi level positions and defect/carrier concentrations.
                Alternatively, can be a ``pymatgen`` ``Vasprun`` object or path to the
                ``vasprun.xml(.gz)`` output of a bulk DOS calculation in VASP.
                Can also be provided later when using ``get_equilibrium_fermi_level()``,
                ``get_fermi_level_and_concentrations`` etc., or set using
                ``DefectThermodynamics.bulk_dos = ...`` (with the same input options).

                Usually this is a static calculation with the `primitive` cell of the bulk
                material, with relatively dense `k`-point sampling (especially for materials
                with disperse band edges) to ensure an accurately-converged DOS and thus Fermi
                level. ``ISMEAR = -5`` (tetrahedron smearing) is usually recommended for best
                convergence wrt `k`-point sampling. Consistent functional settings should be
                used for the bulk DOS and defect supercell calculations.
                (Default: None)
            skip_vbm_check (bool):
                Whether to skip the warning about the DOS VBM differing from the defect
                entries VBM by >0.05 eV. Should only be used when the reason for this
                difference is known/acceptable. (Default: False)

            defect_entries (dict[str, DefectEntry]):

                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect

                format.

                The reduced formula of the bulk structure (e.g. "CdTe").
            bulk_dos (FermiDos):

        Parses the charge transition levels for defect entries in the
        DefectThermodynamics object, and stores information about the stable
        charge states, transition levels etc.

        Defect entries of the same type (e.g. ``Te_i``, ``v_Cd``) are grouped together
        (for plotting and transition level analysis) based on the minimum
        distance between (equivalent) defect sites, to distinguish between
        different inequivalent sites. ``DefectEntry``\s of the same type and with
        a closest distance between equivalent defect sites less than ``dist_tol``
        (1.5 Å by default) are grouped together. If a DefectEntry's site has a
        closest distance less than ``dist_tol`` to multiple sets of equivalent
        sites, then it is matched to the one with the lowest minimum distance.

        Code for parsing the transition levels was originally templated from
        the pyCDT (pymatgen<=2022.7.25) thermodynamics code (deleted in later
        versions).

        This function uses scipy's HalfspaceIntersection
        to construct the polygons corresponding to defect stability as
        a function of the Fermi-level. The Halfspace Intersection
        constructs N-dimensional hyperplanes, in this case N=2, based
        on the equation of defect formation energy with considering chemical
        potentials:
            E_form = E_0^{Corrected} + Q_{defect}*(E_{VBM} + E_{Fermi}).

        Extra hyperplanes are constructed to bound this space so that
        the algorithm can actually find enclosed region.

        This code was modeled after the Halfspace Intersection code for
        the Pourbaix Diagram.

        ``limit`` is set or ``chempots`` corresponds to a single chemical
        potential limit; i.e. {element symbol: chemical potential}).

        The dopability limites are defined by the (first) Fermi level positions at
        which defect formation energies become negative as the Fermi level moves
        towards/beyond the band edges, thus determining the maximum possible Fermi
        level range upon doping for this chemical potential limit.

        which is the VBM eigenvalue of the bulk supercell calculation by
        default, unless ``bulk_band_gap_vr`` is set during defect parsing.

        This is computed by obtaining the formation energy for every stable defect
        with non-zero charge, and then finding the highest Fermi level position at
        which a donor defect (positive charge) has zero formation energy (crosses
        the x-axis) - giving the lower dopability limit, and the lowest Fermi level

        r"""
        Find the doping windows of the defect system, searching over all limits
        (chemical potential limits) in ``chempots`` and returning the most
        p/n-type conditions, or for a given chemical potential limit (if
        ``limit`` is set or ``chempots`` corresponds to a single chemical
        potential limit; i.e. {element symbol: chemical potential}).

        Doping window is defined by the formation energy of the lowest energy
        compensating defect species at the corresponding band edge (i.e. VBM for
        hole doping and CBM for electron doping), as these set the upper limit to
        the formation energy of dopants which could push the Fermi level close to
        the band edge without being negated by defect charge compensation.

        Note that the band edge positions are taken from ``self.vbm`` and
        ``self.band_gap``, which are parsed from the `bulk supercell calculation` by
        default, unless ``bulk_band_gap_vr`` is set during defect parsing.

        If a dopant has a higher formation energy than the doping window at the
        band edge, then its charge will be compensated by formation of the
        corresponding limiting defect species (rather than free carrier populations).

        Args:
            chempots (dict):
                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect
                formation energies (and thus doping windows).
                If ``None`` (default), will use ``self.chempots``.
                This can have the form of ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}]}``
                (the format generated by ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing
                functions (see tutorials)) and specific limits (chemical potential
                limits) can then be chosen using ``limit``.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (limit), in the format: ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases,
                in which case it is the formal chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the
                elemental references) that should be given here, otherwise the absolute
                (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.

                (with the same input options) to set the default chemical potentials

                (Default: None)
            limit (str):
                The chemical potential limit for which to
                calculate formation energies (and thus doping windows). Can be either:

                - ``None``, in which case we search over all limits (chemical potential
                  limits) in ``chempots`` and return the most n/p-type conditions,
                  unless ``chempots`` corresponds to a single chemical potential limit.
                - ``"X-rich"/"X-poor"`` where X is an element in the system, in which
                  case the most X-rich/poor limit will be used (e.g. "Li-rich").
                - A key in the ``(self.)chempots["limits"]`` dictionary.

                The latter two options can only be used if ``chempots`` is in the
                ``doped`` format (see chemical potentials tutorial).
                (Default: None)

        Fermi levels outside or within a small window of the band edges.

        Does not modify the original ``DefectThermodynamics`` (``self``) object!

        This function is used internally in ``doped`` with the
        ``unstable_entries`` argument in ``DefectThermodynamics.plot()``,
        but can also be used to prune out shallow/unstable defect entries for
        other purposes (e.g. if one wants to exclude these entries in

        in such calculations due to their low/near-negligible statibilites;

        Produce a defect formation energy vs Fermi level plot (a.k.a. a defect
        formation energy / transition level diagram), returning the
        ``matplotlib`` ``Figure`` object to allow further plot customisation.

        Note that the band edge positions are taken from ``self.vbm`` and
        ``self.band_gap``, which are parsed from the `bulk supercell calculation` by
        default, unless ``bulk_band_gap_vr`` is set during defect parsing.

        Note that different defect entries (different charge states, and/or ground
        and metastable states (different spin or geometries); e.g. interstitials
        at a given site) are grouped together in distinct defect types according
        to ``self.dist_tol`` , which is also used in transition level analysis and
        defect concentrations. This can be adjusted as shown in the plotting
        customisation tutorial:
        https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/plotting_customisation_tutorial.html

        Args:
            chempots (dict):
                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect
                formation energies. If None (default), will use ``self.chempots``.
                This can have the form of ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}]}``
                (the format generated by ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing
                functions (see tutorials)) and specific limits (chemical potential
                limits) can then be chosen using ``limit``.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (limit), in the format: ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases
                in order to show the formal (relative) chemical potentials above the
                formation energy plot, in which case it is the formal chemical potentials
                (i.e. relative to the elemental references) that should be given here,
                otherwise the absolute (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.

                If None (default), sets all chemical potentials to zero.
                Note that you can also set ``DefectThermodynamics.chempots = ...``
                (with the same input options) to set the default chemical potentials
                for all calculations.
                (Default: None)
            limit (str):
                The chemical potential limit for which to
                plot formation energies. Can be either:

                - None, in which case plots are generated for all limits in ``chempots``.
                - "X-rich"/"X-poor" where X is an element in the system, in which
                  case the most X-rich/poor limit will be used (e.g. "Li-rich").
                - A key in the ``(self.)chempots["limits"]`` dictionary.

                The latter two options can only be used if ``chempots`` is in the
                ``doped`` format (see chemical potentials tutorial).
                (Default: None)
            el_refs (dict):
                Dictionary of elemental reference energies for the chemical potentials
                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical
                potentials, when ``chempots`` has been manually specified as
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``). Unnecessary if ``chempots`` is
                provided/present in format generated by ``doped`` (see tutorials).

                Note that you can also set ``DefectThermodynamics.el_refs = ...``
                (with the same input options) to set the default elemental reference
                energies for all calculations.
                (Default: None)
            all_entries (bool, str):
                Whether to plot the formation energy lines of `all` defect entries,
                rather than the default of showing only the equilibrium states at each
                Fermi level position (traditional). If instead set to "faded", will plot
                the equilibrium states in bold, and all unstable states in faded grey
                (Default: False)
            unstable_entries (bool, str):
                Controls the plotting of unstable/shallow defect states; allowed values
                are ``True``, ``False`` or ``"not shallow"``. If ``"not shallow"``
                (default), defect entries which are predicted to be shallow (perturbed
                host) states according to eigenvalue analysis and only stable for Fermi
                levels within a small window to a band edge (``shallow_stability_tol``)
                are omitted from plotting. If ``False``, `all` defects which are not
                stable for any Fermi level in the band gap are `also` omitted from
                plotting.
                ``shallow_stability_tol`` is set to the smaller of 0.05 eV or 10% of the
                band gap by default, but can be set by a
                ``shallow_charge_stability_tolerance = X`` keyword argument. If
                ``unstable_entries=False``, the Fermi window stability tolerance for all
                defects (default = 0; meaning any in-gap stability) can be set by a
                ``charge_stability_tolerance = X`` keyword argument (positive or negative).
                If ``True``, defect entries are not pruned based on stability/shallow
                classification. See ``prune_to_stable_entries`` for more info.
            chempot_table (Optional[bool]):
                Whether to include a table of the chemical potentials above the formation
                energy plot. If ``None`` (default), shown if multiple plots are generated
                (i.e. multiple chemical potential limits) else not shown.
            style_file (PathLike):
                Path to a mplstyle file to use for the plot. If None (default), uses
                the default doped style (from ``doped/utils/doped.mplstyle``).
            xlim:
                Tuple (min,max) giving the range of the x-axis (Fermi level). May want
                to set manually when including transition level labels, to avoid crossing
                the axes. Default is to plot from -0.3 to +0.3 eV above the band gap.
            ylim:
                Tuple (min,max) giving the range for the y-axis (formation energy). May
                want to set manually when including transition level labels, to avoid
                crossing the axes. Default is from 0 to just above the maximum formation
                energy value in the band gap.
            fermi_level (float):
                If set, plots a dashed vertical line at this Fermi level value, typically
                used to indicate the equilibrium Fermi level position (e.g. calculated
                with py-sc-fermi). (Default: None)
            include_site_info (bool):
                Whether to include site info in defect names in the plot legend (e.g.
                $Cd_{i_{C3v}}^{0}$ rather than $Cd_{i}^{0}$). Default is ``False``, where
                site info is not included unless we have inequivalent sites for the same
                defect type. If, even with site info added, there are duplicate defect
                names, then "-a", "-b", "-c" etc are appended to the names to differentiate.
            colormap (str, matplotlib.colors.Colormap):
                Colormap to use for the formation energy lines, either as a string
                (which can be a colormap name from
                https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/explain/colors/colormaps or from
                https://www.fabiocrameri.ch/colourmaps -- append 'S' if using a sequential
                colormap from the latter) or a ``Colormap`` / ``ListedColormap`` object.
                If ``None`` (default), uses ``tab10`` with ``alpha=0.75`` (if 10 or fewer
                lines to plot), ``tab20`` (if 20 or fewer lines) or ``batlow`` (if more
                than 20 lines; citation: https://zenodo.org/records/8409685).
            linestyles (list):
                Linestyles to use for the formation energy lines, either as a single
                linestyle (``str``) or list of linestyles (``list[str]``) in the order of
                appearance of lines in the plot legend. Default is ``"-"``; i.e. solid
                linestyle for all entries.
            auto_labels (bool):
                Whether to automatically label the transition levels with their charge
                states. If there are many transition levels, this can be quite ugly.
                (Default: False)
            filename (PathLike): Filename to save the plot to. (Default: None (not saved))
            **kwargs:
                Additional keyword arguments for advanced customisation, such as
                ``shallow_charge_stability_tolerance`` or ``charge_stability_tolerance``
                for controlling stability window tolerances with the ``unstable_entries``
                parameter (see argument description for more info).

        Returns:
            ``matplotlib`` ``Figure`` object, or list of ``Figure`` objects if multiple
            limits chosen.

        Generates a table of the bulk-site & relaxed defect point group
        symmetries, spin/orientational/total degeneracies and (bulk-)site
        multiplicities for each defect in the ``DefectThermodynamics`` object.

        Table Key:

        - 'Defect': Defect name (without charge)
        - 'q': Defect charge state.
        - 'Site_Symm': Point group symmetry of the defect site in the bulk cell.
        - 'Defect_Symm': Point group symmetry of the relaxed defect.
        - 'g_Orient': Orientational degeneracy of the defect.
        - 'g_Spin': Spin degeneracy of the defect.
        - 'g_Total': Total degeneracy of the defect.
        - 'Mult': Multiplicity of the defect site in the bulk cell, per primitive unit cell.

        For interstitials, the bulk site symmetry corresponds to the
        point symmetry of the interstitial site with `no relaxation
        of the host structure`, while for vacancies/substitutions it is
        simply the symmetry of their corresponding bulk site.
        This corresponds to the point symmetry of ``DefectEntry.defect``,
        or ``calculation_metadata["bulk_site"]/["unrelaxed_defect_structure"]``.

        Point group symmetries are taken from the calculation_metadata
        ("relaxed point symmetry" and "bulk site symmetry") if
        present (should be, if parsed with doped and defect supercell
        doesn't break host periodicity), otherwise are attempted to be
        recalculated.

        Note: doped tries to use the defect_entry.defect_supercell to determine
        the `relaxed` site symmetry. However, it should be noted that this is not
        guaranteed to work in all cases; namely for non-diagonal supercell
        expansions, or sometimes for non-scalar supercell expansion matrices
        (e.g. a 2x1x2 expansion)(particularly with high-symmetry materials)
        which can mess up the periodicity of the cell. doped tries to automatically
        check if this is the case, and will warn you if so.

        This can also be checked by using this function on your doped `generated` defects:

        .. code-block:: python

            from doped.generation import get_defect_name_from_entry
            for defect_name, defect_entry in defect_gen.items():
                print(defect_name, get_defect_name_from_entry(defect_entry, relaxed=False),
                      get_defect_name_from_entry(defect_entry), "\n")

        And if the point symmetries match in each case, then doped should be able to
        correctly determine the final relaxed defect symmetry (and orientational degeneracy)
        - otherwise periodicity-breaking prevents this.

        If periodicity-breaking prevents auto-symmetry determination, you can manually
        determine the relaxed defect and bulk-site point symmetries, and/or orientational
        degeneracy, from visualising the structures (e.g. using VESTA)(can use
        ``get_orientational_degeneracy`` to obtain the corresponding orientational
        degeneracy factor for given defect/bulk-site point symmetries) and setting the
        corresponding values in the
        ``calculation_metadata['relaxed point symmetry']/['bulk site symmetry']`` and/or
        ``degeneracy_factors['orientational degeneracy']`` attributes.
        Note that the bulk-site point symmetry corresponds to that of ``DefectEntry.defect``,
        or equivalently ``calculation_metadata["bulk_site"]/["unrelaxed_defect_structure"]``,
        which for vacancies/substitutions is the symmetry of the corresponding bulk site,
        while for interstitials it is the point symmetry of the `final relaxed` interstitial
        site when placed in the (unrelaxed) bulk structure.
        The degeneracy factor is used in the calculation of defect/carrier concentrations
        and Fermi level behaviour (see e.g. https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00043A &
        https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E).

        Args:
            skip_formatting (bool):

                relaxed defect point symmetries and thus orientational

                the ``Materials Project`` and is larger than the ``pymatgen``
                default of ``0.01`` (which is used by ``doped`` for
                unrelaxed/bulk structures) to account for residual structural
                noise in relaxed defect supercells.
                You may want to adjust for your system (e.g. if there are
                very slight octahedral distortions etc.). If ``symprec`` is
                set, then the point symmetries and corresponding orientational

        Compute the `equilibrium` concentrations (in cm^-3) for all
        ``DefectEntry``\s in the ``DefectThermodynamics`` object, at a given
        chemical potential limit, Fermi level and temperature, assuming the
        dilute limit approximation.

        Note that these are the `equilibrium` defect concentrations!
        ``DefectThermodynamics.get_fermi_level_and_concentrations()``
        can instead be used to calculate the Fermi level and defect
        concentrations for a material grown/annealed at higher temperatures
        and then cooled (quenched) to room/operating temperature (where defect
        concentrations are assumed to remain fixed) - this is known as the
        frozen defect approach and is typically the most valid approximation
        (see its docstring for more information).

        The degeneracy/multiplicity factor "g" is an important parameter in the
        defect concentration equation (see discussion in
        https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00043A and https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E),
        affecting the final concentration by up to ~2 orders of magnitude. This
        factor is taken from the product of the ``defect_entry.defect.multiplicity``
        and ``defect_entry.degeneracy_factors`` attributes.

        Note that the ``FermiSolver`` class implements a number of convenience
        methods for thermodynamic analyses; such as scanning over temperatures,
        chemical potentials, effective dopant concentrations etc, minimising or
        maximising a target property (e.g. defect/carrier concentration), and
        also allowing greater control over constraints and approximations in
        defect concentration calculations (i.e. fixed/variable defect(s) and
        charge states), which may be useful. See the ``FermiSolver`` tutorial:
        https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fermisolver_tutorial.html

                will use ``self.chempots`` (= 0 for all chemical potentials by default).
                This can have the form of ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}]}``
                (the format generated by ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing
                functions (see tutorials)) and specific limits (chemical potential
                limits) can then be chosen using ``limit``.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (``limit``), in the format:
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases,
                in which case it is the formal chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the
                elemental references) that should be given here, otherwise the absolute
                (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.

                Note that you can also set ``DefectThermodynamics.chempots = ...``
                (with the same input options) to set the default chemical potentials
                for all calculations.
                (Default: None)
            limit (str):
                The chemical potential limit for which to
                obtain the equilibrium concentrations. Can be either:

                - ``None``, if ``chempots`` corresponds to a single chemical potential
                  limit - otherwise will use the first chemical potential limit in the
                  ``chempots`` dict.
                - ``"X-rich"/"X-poor"`` where X is an element in the system, in which
                  case the most X-rich/poor limit will be used (e.g. "Li-rich").
                - A key in the ``(self.)chempots["limits"]`` dictionary.

                The latter two options can only be used if ``chempots`` is in the
                ``doped`` format (see chemical potentials tutorial).
                (Default: None)
            el_refs (dict):
                Dictionary of elemental reference energies for the chemical potentials
                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical
                potentials, when ``chempots`` has been manually specified as
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``). Unnecessary if ``chempots`` is
                provided/present in format generated by ``doped`` (see tutorials).

                Note that you can also set ``DefectThermodynamics.el_refs = ...``
                (with the same input options) to set the default elemental reference
                energies for all calculations.
                (Default: None)
            fermi_level (float):
                Value corresponding to the electron chemical potential, referenced
                to the VBM (using ``self.vbm``, which is the VBM of the `bulk supercell`
                calculation by default). If None (default), set to the mid-gap Fermi
                level (E_g/2).
            per_charge (bool):
                Whether to break down the defect concentrations into individual defect charge
                states (e.g. ``v_Cd_0``, ``v_Cd_-1``, ``v_Cd_-2`` instead of ``v_Cd``).
                (default: True)
            per_site (bool):
                Whether to return the concentrations as percent concentrations per site,
                rather than the default of per cm^3. (default: False)
            skip_formatting (bool):
                Whether to skip formatting the defect charge states and concentrations as
                strings (and keep as ``int``\s and ``float``\s instead). (default: False)
            site_competition (bool | str):
                If ``True`` (default), uses the updated Fermi-Dirac-like formula for
                defect concentration, which accounts for defect site competition at high
                concentrations (see Kasamatsu et al. (10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.022)
                appendix for derivation -- updated here to additionally account for
                configurational degeneracies ``g`` (see https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E)),
                which gives the following defect concentration equation:
                ``N_X = N*[g*exp(-E/kT) / (1 + sum(g_i*exp(-E_i/kT)))]`` where ``i``
                runs over all defects which occupy the same site as the defect of interest.
                If ``False``, uses the standard dilute limit approximation.
                Alternatively ``site_competition`` can be set to a string (``"verbose"``),
                which will give the same behaviour as ``True`` as well as including the
                lattice site indices (used to determine which defects will compete for the
                same sites) in the output ``DataFrame``.
            lean (bool):
                Whether to return a leaner ``DataFrame`` with `only` the defect name, charge
                state, and concentration in cm^-3 (assumes ``skip_formatting=True`` and
                ``per_site=False``). Only really intended for internal ``doped`` usage, to
                reduce compute times when calculating defect concentrations repeatedly.
                (default: False)

        Returns:
            ``pandas`` ``DataFrame`` of defect concentrations (and formation energies)
            for each ``DefectEntry`` in the ``DefectThermodynamics`` object.

        Calculate the self-consistent Fermi level, at a given chemical
        potential limit and temperature, assuming `equilibrium` defect
        concentrations (i.e. under annealing) and the dilute limit
        approximation, by self-consistently solving for the Fermi level which
        yields charge neutrality.

        Note that the returned Fermi level is given relative to ``self.vbm``,
        which is the VBM eigenvalue of the bulk supercell calculation by
        default, unless ``bulk_band_gap_vr`` is set during defect parsing.

        Note that this assumes `equilibrium` defect concentrations!
        ``DefectThermodynamics.get_fermi_level_and_concentrations()``
        can instead be used to calculate the Fermi level and defect
        concentrations for a material grown/annealed at higher temperatures
        and then cooled (quenched) to room/operating temperature (where defect
        concentrations are assumed to remain fixed) - this is known as the
        frozen defect approach and is typically the most valid approximation
        (see its docstring for more information).

        Note that the bulk DOS calculation should be well-converged with
        respect to `k`-points for accurate Fermi level predictions!

        The degeneracy/multiplicity factor "g" is an important parameter in the
        defect concentration equation (see discussion in
        https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00043A and https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E),
        affecting the final concentration by up to ~2 orders of magnitude. This
        factor is taken from the product of the ``defect_entry.defect.multiplicity``
        and ``defect_entry.degeneracy_factors`` attributes.

        Note that the ``FermiSolver`` class implements a number of convenience
        methods for thermodynamic analyses; such as scanning over temperatures,
        chemical potentials, effective dopant concentrations etc, minimising or
        maximising a target property (e.g. defect/carrier concentration), and
        also allowing greater control over constraints and approximations in
        defect concentration calculations (i.e. fixed/variable defect(s) and
        charge states), which may be useful. See the ``FermiSolver`` tutorial:
        https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fermisolver_tutorial.html

        Args:
            bulk_dos (FermiDos or Vasprun or PathLike):
                ``pymatgen`` ``FermiDos`` for the bulk electronic density of states (DOS),
                for calculating carrier concentrations. Alternatively, can be a ``pymatgen``
                ``Vasprun`` object or path to the ``vasprun.xml(.gz)`` output of a bulk DOS
                calculation in VASP -- however this will be much slower when looping over many
                conditions as it will re-parse the DOS each time! (So preferably use
                ``get_fermi_dos()`` as shown in the defect thermodynamics tutorial).

                Usually this is a static calculation with the `primitive` cell of the bulk
                material, with relatively dense `k`-point sampling (especially for materials
                with disperse band edges) to ensure an accurately-converged DOS and thus Fermi
                level. ``ISMEAR = -5`` (tetrahedron smearing) is usually recommended for best
                convergence wrt `k`-point sampling. Consistent functional settings should be
                used for the bulk DOS and defect supercell calculations.

                ``bulk_dos`` can also be left as ``None`` (default), if it has previously
                been provided and parsed, and thus is set as the ``self.bulk_dos`` attribute.
                If provided, will overwrite the ``self.bulk_dos`` attribute!
            temperature (float):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the equilibrium Fermi level.
                Default is 300 K.
            chempots (dict):
                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect
                formation energies (and thus concentrations and Fermi level).
                If ``None`` (default), will use ``self.chempots`` (= 0 for all chemical
                potentials by default).
                This can have the form of ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}]}``
                (the format generated by ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing
                functions (see tutorials)) and specific limits (chemical potential
                limits) can then be chosen using ``limit``.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (limit), in the format: ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases,
                in which case it is the formal chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the
                elemental references) that should be given here, otherwise the absolute
                (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.

                (with the same input options) to set the default chemical potentials
                for all calculations.

            limit (str):
                The chemical potential limit for which to
                determine the equilibrium Fermi level. Can be either:

                - ``None``, if ``chempots`` corresponds to a single chemical potential
                  limit - otherwise will use the first chemical potential limit in the
                  ``chempots`` dict.
                - ``"X-rich"/"X-poor"`` where X is an element in the system, in which
                  case the most X-rich/poor limit will be used (e.g. "Li-rich").
                - A key in the ``(self.)chempots["limits"]`` dictionary.

                The latter two options can only be used if ``chempots`` is in the

                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical
                potentials, when ``chempots`` has been manually specified as
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``). Unnecessary if ``chempots`` is

                by >0.05 eV. Should only be used when the reason for this difference is
                known/acceptable. (default: False)
            effective_dopant_concentration (float):
                Fixed concentration (in cm^-3) of an arbitrary dopant/impurity in the
                material to include in the charge neutrality condition, in order to
                analyse the Fermi level / doping response under hypothetical doping
                conditions. If a negative value is given, the dopant is assumed to be
                an acceptor dopant (i.e. negative defect charge state), while a positive
                value corresponds to donor doping. For dopants of charge ``q``, the input
                value should be ``q * 'Dopant Concentration'``.

                concentrations (see Kasamatsu et al. (10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.022)

                runs over all defects which occupy the same site as the defect of interest.
                If ``False``, uses the standard dilute limit approximation.

        Returns:
            Self consistent Fermi level (in eV from the VBM (``self.vbm``)), and the
            corresponding electron and hole concentrations (in cm^-3) if ``return_concs=True``.

        Calculate the self-consistent Fermi level and corresponding
        carrier/defect calculations, for a given chemical potential limit,
        annealing temperature and quenched/operating temperature, using the
        frozen defect and dilute limit approximations under the constraint of
        charge neutrality.

        This function works by calculating the self-consistent Fermi level
        and total concentration of each defect type at the annealing temperature,
        then fixing the total concentrations to these values and
        re-calculating the self-consistent (constrained equilibrium) Fermi
        level and relative charge state concentrations under this constraint
        at the quenched/operating temperature.

        According to the 'frozen defect' approximation, we typically expect
        defect concentrations to reach equilibrium during annealing/crystal
        growth (at elevated temperatures), but `not` upon quenching (i.e. at
        room/operating temperature) where we expect kinetic inhibition of
        defect annhiliation and hence non-equilibrium defect concentrations /
        Fermi level. Typically, this is approximated by computing the
        equilibrium Fermi level and defect concentrations at the annealing
        temperature, and then assuming the total concentration of each defect
        is fixed to this value, but that the relative populations of defect
        charge states (and the Fermi level) can re-equilibrate at the lower
        (room) temperature. See discussion in https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E
        (brief), https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2019.06.017 (detailed) and
        ``doped``/``py-sc-fermi`` tutorials for more information.
        In certain cases (such as Li-ion battery materials or extremely slow
        charge capture/emission), these approximations may have to be adjusted
        such that some defects/charge states are considered fixed and some are
        allowed to re-equilibrate (e.g. highly mobile Li vacancies/interstitials).
        The ``FermiSolver`` class can be used in these cases for more
        fine-grained control over constraints and approximations in defect
        concentration calculations, as demonstrated in the tutorial:
        https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fermisolver_tutorial.html

        Note that different defect entries (different charge states, and/or ground
        and metastable states (different spin or geometries); e.g. interstitials
        at a given site) are grouped together in distinct defect types according
        to ``self.dist_tol`` , which is also used in plotting and transition level
        analysis. In the frozen defect approximation here, the total concentration
        of a given defect type group is calculated at the annealing temperature,
        and then the equilibrium relative population of the constituent entries is
        recalculated at the quenched temperature.

        Note that the bulk DOS calculation should be well-converged with respect
        to `k`-points for accurate Fermi level predictions!

        The degeneracy/multiplicity factor "g" is an important parameter in the
        defect concentration equation (see discussion in
        https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00043A and https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E),
        affecting the final concentration by up to ~2 orders of magnitude. This
        factor is taken from the product of the ``defect_entry.defect.multiplicity``
        and ``defect_entry.degeneracy_factors`` attributes.

        Note that, in addition to finer-grained control over constraints and
        approximations as mentioned above, the ``FermiSolver`` class implements
        a number of convenience methods for thermodynamic analyses; such as
        scanning over temperatures, chemical potentials, effective dopant
        concentrations etc, minimising or maximising a target property
        (e.g. defect/carrier concentration), which may be useful -- see tutorial.

        Args:
            bulk_dos (FermiDos or Vasprun or PathLike):
                ``pymatgen`` ``FermiDos`` for the bulk electronic density of states (DOS),
                for calculating carrier concentrations. Alternatively, can be a ``pymatgen``
                ``Vasprun`` object or path to the ``vasprun.xml(.gz)`` output of a bulk DOS
                calculation in VASP -- however this will be much slower when looping over many
                conditions as it will re-parse the DOS each time! (So preferably use
                ``get_fermi_dos()`` as shown in the defect thermodynamics tutorial).

                Usually this is a static calculation with the `primitive` cell of the bulk
                material, with relatively dense `k`-point sampling (especially for materials
                with disperse band edges) to ensure an accurately-converged DOS and thus Fermi
                level. ``ISMEAR = -5`` (tetrahedron smearing) is usually recommended for best
                convergence wrt `k`-point sampling. Consistent functional settings should be
                used for the bulk DOS and defect supercell calculations.

                ``bulk_dos`` can also be left as ``None`` (default), if it has previously
                been provided and parsed, and thus is set as the ``self.bulk_dos`` attribute.
                If provided, will overwrite the ``self.bulk_dos`` attribute!
            annealing_temperature (float):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the high temperature
                (fixed) total defect concentrations, which should correspond to the
                highest temperature during annealing/synthesis of the material (at
                which we assume equilibrium defect concentrations) within the frozen
                defect approach. Default is 1000 K.
            quenched_temperature (float):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the self-consistent
                (constrained equilibrium) Fermi level and carrier concentrations,
                given the fixed total concentrations, which should correspond to
                operating temperature of the material (typically room temperature).
                Default is 300 K.
            chempots (dict):
                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect
                formation energies (and thus concentrations and Fermi level).
                If ``None`` (default), will use ``self.chempots`` (= 0 for all chemical
                potentials by default).
                This can have the form of ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}]}``
                (the format generated by ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing
                functions (see tutorials)) and specific limits (chemical potential
                limits) can then be chosen using ``limit``.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (limit), in the format: ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases,
                in which case it is the formal chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the
                elemental references) that should be given here, otherwise the absolute
                (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.

                Note that you can also set ``DefectThermodynamics.chempots = ...``
                (with the same input options) to set the default chemical potentials
                for all calculations.
                (Default: None)
            limit (str):
                The chemical potential limit for which to
                determine the Fermi level and concentrations. Can be either:

                - ``None``, if ``chempots`` corresponds to a single chemical potential
                  limit - otherwise will use the first chemical potential limit in the
                  ``chempots`` dict.
                - ``"X-rich"/"X-poor"`` where X is an element in the system, in which
                  case the most X-rich/poor limit will be used (e.g. "Li-rich").
                - A key in the ``(self.)chempots["limits"]`` dictionary.

                The latter two options can only be used if ``chempots`` is in the
                ``doped`` format (see chemical potentials tutorial).
                (Default: None)
            el_refs (dict):
                Dictionary of elemental reference energies for the chemical potentials
                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical
                potentials, when ``chempots`` has been manually specified as
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``). Unnecessary if ``chempots`` is
                provided/present in format generated by ``doped`` (see tutorials).

                Note that you can also set ``DefectThermodynamics.el_refs = ...``
                (with the same input options) to set the default elemental reference
                energies for all calculations.
                (Default: None)
            delta_gap (float):
                Change in band gap (in eV) of the host material at the annealing
                temperature (e.g. due to thermal renormalisation), relative to the
                original band gap of the ``FermiDos`` object (assumed to correspond to the
                quenched temperature). If set, applies a scissor correction to ``fermi_dos``
                which renormalises the band gap symmetrically about the VBM and CBM (i.e.
                assuming equal up/downshifts of the band-edges around their original
                eigenvalues) while the defect levels remain fixed.
                (Default: 0)
            per_charge (bool):
                Whether to break down the defect concentrations into individual defect charge
                states (e.g. ``v_Cd_0``, ``v_Cd_-1``, ``v_Cd_-2`` instead of ``v_Cd``).
                (default: True)
            per_site (bool):
                Whether to return the concentrations as percent concentrations per site,
                rather than the default of per cm^3. (default: False)
            skip_formatting (bool):
                Whether to skip formatting the defect charge states and concentrations as
                strings (and keep as ``int``\s and ``float``\s instead). (default: False)
            return_annealing_values (bool):
                If True, also returns the Fermi level, electron and hole concentrations and
                defect concentrations at the annealing temperature. (default: False)
            effective_dopant_concentration (float):
                Fixed concentration (in cm^-3) of an arbitrary dopant/impurity in the
                material to include in the charge neutrality condition, in order to
                analyse the Fermi level / doping response under hypothetical doping
                conditions. If a negative value is given, the dopant is assumed to be
                an acceptor dopant (i.e. negative defect charge state), while a positive
                value corresponds to donor doping. For dopants of charge ``q``, the input
                value should be ``q * 'Dopant Concentration'``.
                (Default: None; no extrinsic dopant)
            site_competition (bool | str):
                If ``True`` (default), uses the updated Fermi-Dirac-like formula for
                defect concentration, which accounts for defect site competition at high
                concentrations (see Kasamatsu et al. (10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.022)
                appendix for derivation -- updated here to additionally account for
                configurational degeneracies ``g`` (see https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E)),

        r"""
        Class to calculate the Fermi level, defect and carrier concentrations
        under various conditions, using the input ``DefectThermodynamics``
        object.

        This class implements a number of convenience methods for thermodynamic
        analyses; such as scanning over temperatures, chemical potentials,
        effective dopant concentrations etc, minimising or maximising a target
        property (e.g. defect/carrier concentration), and also allowing greater
        control over constraints and approximations in defect concentration
        calculations; such as specifying (known) fixed concentrations of a
        defect/dopant, specifying defects to exclude from high-temperature
        concentration fixing in the frozen defect approximation
        (e.g. highly-mobile defects), and/or fixing defect charge states upon
        quenching.

        This constructor initializes a ``FermiSolver`` object, setting up the
        necessary attributes, which includes loading the bulk density of states
        (DOS) data from either the input ``DefectThermodynamics`` or ``bulk_dos``.

        If using the ``py-sc-fermi`` backend (currently required for the
        ``fixed_defects``, ``free_defects`` and ``fix_charge_states`` options in
        the scanning functions), please cite the code paper:
        Squires et al., (2023). Journal of Open Source Software, 8(82), 4962
        https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.04962

        Note that the ``delta_gap`` argument used in ``DefectThermodynamics``
        methods is not directly supported in this class. If band gap modulation
        is desired, it is recommended to use the ``DefectThermodynamics`` methods
        directly with ``delta_gap`` as shown in the (advanced) defect thermodynamics
        tutorials.

        Args:
            defect_thermodynamics (DefectThermodynamics):
                A ``DefectThermodynamics`` object, providing access to defect
                formation energies and other related thermodynamic properties.
            bulk_dos (FermiDos or Vasprun or PathLike):
                Either a path to the ``vasprun.xml(.gz)`` output of a bulk DOS
                calculation in VASP, a ``pymatgen`` ``Vasprun`` object or a
                ``pymatgen`` ``FermiDos`` for the bulk electronic DOS, for
                calculating carrier concentrations.
                If not provided, uses ``DefectThermodynamics.bulk_dos`` if present.

                Usually this is a static calculation with the `primitive` cell of
                the bulk material, with relatively dense `k`-point sampling
                (especially for materials with disperse band edges) to ensure an
                accurately-converged DOS and thus Fermi level. ``ISMEAR = -5``
                (tetrahedron smearing) is usually recommended for best convergence
                wrt `k`-point sampling. Consistent functional settings should be
                used for the bulk DOS and defect supercell calculations.

                Note that the ``DefectThermodynamics.bulk_dos`` will be set to match
                this input, if provided.
            chempots (Optional[dict]):
                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect
                formation energies (and thus concentrations and Fermi level), under
                different chemical environments.

                If ``None`` (default), will use ``DefectThermodynamics.chempots``
                (= 0 for all chemical potentials by default, if not set).

                This can have the form of ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}], ...}``
                (the format generated by ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing
                functions (see tutorials)) and specific limits (chemical potential
                limits) can then be chosen using ``limit``.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (limit), in the format: ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases,
                in which case it is the formal chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the
                elemental references) that should be given here, otherwise the absolute
                (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.

                If provided here, then ``defect_thermodynamics.chempots`` is set to this
                input.

                Chemical potentials can also be supplied later in each analysis function, or
                set using ``FermiSolver.defect_thermodynamics.chempots = ...`` or
                ``DefectThermodynamics.chempots = ...`` (with the same input options).
            el_refs (Optional[dict]):
                Dictionary of elemental reference energies for the chemical potentials
                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical
                potentials, when ``chempots`` has been manually specified as
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``). Unnecessary if ``chempots`` is
                provided/present in ``DefectThermodynamics`` in the format generated by
                ``doped`` (see tutorials), or if ``DefectThermodynamics.el_refs`` has been
                set.

                If provided here, then ``defect_thermodynamics.el_refs`` is set to this
                input.

                Elemental reference energies can also be supplied later in each analysis
                function, or set using ``FermiSolver.defect_thermodynamics.el_refs = ...``
                or ``DefectThermodynamics.el_refs = ...`` (with the same input options).
                Default is ``None``.
            backend (Optional[str]):
                The code backend to use for the thermodynamic calculations, which
                can be either ``"doped"`` or ``"py-sc-fermi"``. ``"py-sc-fermi"``
                allows the use of ``fixed_defects`` and ``free_defects`` for advanced
                constrained defect equilibria (e.g. mobile defects, see advanced
                thermodynamics tutorial), while ``"doped"`` is usually much quicker.
                Default is ``doped``, but will attempt to switch to ``py-sc-fermi``
                if required (and installed).
            skip_vbm_check (bool):
                Whether to skip the warning about the DOS VBM differing from
                ``DefectThermodynamics.vbm`` by >0.05 eV. Should only be used when the
                reason for this difference is known/acceptable. Default is ``False``.

                difference is known/acceptable.
            multiplicity_scaling (int):
                Scaling factor to account for the difference in volume between the

        Calculate the self-consistent Fermi level and corresponding
        carrier/defect calculations under pseudo-equilibrium conditions given a
        set of elemental chemical potentials, an annealing temperature, and a
        quenched temperature.

        Typically not intended for direct usage, as the same functionality
        is provided by
        ``DefectThermodynamics.get_fermi_level_and_concentrations()``.
        Rather this is used internally to provide a unified interface for both
        backends, within the ``scan_...`` functions.

        'Pseudo-equilibrium' here refers to the use of frozen defect and dilute
        limit approximations under the constraint of charge neutrality (i.e.
        constrained equilibrium). According to the 'frozen defect' approximation,
        we typically expect defect concentrations to reach equilibrium during
        annealing/crystal growth (at elevated temperatures), but `not` upon
        quenching (i.e. at room/operating temperature) where we expect kinetic
        inhibition of defect annhiliation and hence non-equilibrium defect
        concentrations / Fermi level.
        Typically this is approximated by computing the equilibrium Fermi level and
        defect concentrations at the annealing temperature, and then assuming the
        total concentration of each defect is fixed to this value, but that the
        relative populations of defect charge states (and the Fermi level) can
        re-equilibrate at the lower (room) temperature. See discussion in
        https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E (brief),
        https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2019.06.017 (detailed) and
        ``doped``/``py-sc-fermi`` tutorials for more information.
        In certain cases (such as Li-ion battery materials or extremely slow charge
        capture/emission), these approximations may have to be adjusted such that some
        defects/charge states are considered fixed and some are allowed to
        re-equilibrate (e.g. highly mobile Li vacancies/interstitials). Modelling
        these specific cases can be achieved using the ``free_defects`` and/or
        ``fix_charge_states`` options, as demonstrated in:
        https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/fermisolver_tutorial.html

        This function works by calculating the self-consistent Fermi level and total
        concentration of each defect at the annealing temperature, then fixing the
        total concentrations to these values and re-calculating the self-consistent
        (constrained equilibrium) Fermi level and relative charge state concentrations
        under this constraint at the quenched/operating temperature. If using the
        ``"py-sc-fermi"`` backend, then you can optionally fix the concentrations of
        individual defect `charge states` (rather than fixing total defect concentrations)
        using ``fix_charge_states=True``, and/or optionally specify ``free_defects`` to
        exclude from high-temperature concentration fixing (e.g. highly mobile defects).

        Note that the bulk DOS calculation should be well-converged with respect to
        k-points for accurate Fermi level predictions!

        The degeneracy/multiplicity factor "g" is an important parameter in the defect
        concentration equation and thus Fermi level calculation (see discussion in
        https://doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00043A and https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E),
        affecting the final concentration by up to 2 orders of magnitude. This factor
        is taken from the product of the ``defect_entry.defect.multiplicity`` and
        ``defect_entry.degeneracy_factors`` attributes, automatically determined
        during ``doped`` defect calculation parsing.

        Args:
            single_chempot_dict (dict[str, float]):
                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the
                pseudo-equilibrium Fermi level position and defect/carrier
                concentrations. Here, this should be a dictionary of chemical
                potentials for a single limit (``limit``), in the format:
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If ``el_refs`` is provided or set in ``self.defect_thermodynamics.el_refs``
                then it is the `formal` chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the elemental
                reference energies) that should be given here, otherwise the absolute
                (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.
            el_refs (dict[str, float]):
                Dictionary of elemental reference energies for the chemical potentials
                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}``. Unnecessary if
                ``self.defect_thermodynamics.el_refs`` is set (i.e. if ``chempots`` was
                provided to ``self.defect_thermodynamics`` in the format generated by
                ``doped``).
                (Default: None)
            annealing_temperature (float):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the high temperature
                (fixed) total defect concentrations, which should correspond to the
                highest temperature during annealing/synthesis of the material (at
                which we assume equilibrium defect concentrations) within the frozen
                defect approach.
                Defaults to 1000 K.
            quenched_temperature (float):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the self-consistent
                (constrained equilibrium) Fermi level and carrier concentrations,
                given the fixed total concentrations, which should correspond to
                operating temperature of the material (typically room temperature).
                Defaults to 300 K.
            effective_dopant_concentration (Optional[float]):
                The fixed concentration (in cm^-3) of an arbitrary dopant or
                impurity in the material. This value is included in the charge
                neutrality condition to analyze the Fermi level and doping
                response under hypothetical doping conditions.
                A positive value corresponds to donor doping, while a negative
                value corresponds to acceptor doping. For dopants of charge ``q``,
                the input value should be ``q * 'Dopant Concentration'``.
                Defaults to ``None``, corresponding to no additional extrinsic
                dopant.
            fixed_defects (Optional[dict[str, float]]):
                A dictionary of defect concentrations to fix at the quenched
                temperature, in the format: ``{defect_name: concentration}``,
                where ``defect_name`` is the name of a defect entry without
                (e.g. ``"v_O"``) or with (e.g. ``"v_O_+2"``) the charge state;
                which will then fix either the total concentration of that defect
                or only the concentration for the specified charge state.
                Concentrations should be given in cm^-3. This can be used to fix
                the concentrations of specific defects regardless of the chemical
                potentials, or anneal-quench procedure (e.g. to simulate the effect
                of a fixed impurity concentration).
                Defaults to ``None``.
            free_defects (Optional[list[str]]):
                A list of defects (without charge states) to be excluded from
                high-temperature concentration fixing. Useful for highly mobile
                defects that are not expected to be "frozen-in" upon quenching.
                Any defects whose names begin with a string in this list will be
                excluded from high-temperature concentration fixing (e.g. ``"v_"``
                will match all vacancy defects with ``doped``\-formatted names).
                Defaults to ``None``.
            append_chempots (bool):
                Whether to append the chemical potentials (and effective dopant
                concentration, if provided) to the output ``DataFrame``.
                Default is ``True``.
            fix_charge_states (bool):
                Whether to fix the concentrations of individual defect charge states
                (``True``) or allow charge states to vary while keeping total defect
                concentrations fixed (``False``) upon quenching. Not expected to be
                physically sensible in most cases. Defaults to ``False``.
            site_competition (bool | str):
                If ``True`` (default), uses the updated Fermi-Dirac-like formula for
                defect concentration, which accounts for defect site competition at high
                concentrations (see Kasamatsu et al. (10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.022)
                appendix for derivation -- updated here to additionally account for
                configurational degeneracies ``g`` (see https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E)),
                which gives the following defect concentration equation:
                ``N_X = N*[g*exp(-E/kT) / (1 + sum(g_i*exp(-E_i/kT)))]`` where ``i``
                runs over all defects which occupy the same site as the defect of interest.
                If ``False``, uses the standard dilute limit approximation.
                Alternatively ``site_competition`` can be set to a string (``"verbose"``),
                which will give the same behaviour as ``True`` as well as including the
                lattice site indices (used to determine which defects will compete for the
                same sites) in the output ``DataFrame``.
                Note that this option is only used if the ``doped`` backend is being used,
                not supported for the ``py-sc-fermi`` backend.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame:
                A ``DataFrame`` containing the defect and carrier concentrations
                under pseudo-equilibrium conditions, along with the self-consistent
                Fermi level.

        Scan over a range of temperatures and solve for the defect

        If ``annealing_temperature_range`` (and ``quenched_temperature_range``;
        just 300 K by default) are specified, then the frozen defect approximation
        is employed, whereby total defect concentrations are calculated at the
        elevated annealing temperature, then fixed at these values (unless
        ``free_defects`` or ``fix_charge_states`` are specified) and the Fermi
        level and relative charge state populations are recalculated at the
        quenched temperature. Otherwise, if only ``temperature_range`` is
        specified, then the Fermi level and defect/carrier concentrations are
        calculated assuming thermodynamic equilibrium at each temperature.

        See ``(pseudo_)equilibrium_solve`` docstrings for more details.

        Args:
            annealing_temperature_range (Optional[Union[float, list[float]]]):
                Temperature range in Kelvin at which to calculate the high
                temperature (fixed) total defect concentrations, which should
                correspond to the highest temperature during annealing/synthesis
                of the material (at which we assume equilibrium defect
                concentrations) within the frozen defect approach. Default is
                ``None`` (uses ``temperature_range`` under thermodynamic equilibrium).
            quenched_temperature_range (Union[float, list[float]]):
                Temperature, or range of temperatures, in Kelvin at which to
                calculate the self-consistent (constrained equilibrium) Fermi
                level and carrier concentrations, given the fixed total concentrations,
                which should correspond to operating temperature of the material
                (typically room temperature).
                Default is just 300 K.
            temperature_range (Union[float, list[float]]):
                Temperature range to solve over, under thermodynamic equilibrium
                (if ``annealing_temperature_range`` is not specified).
                Defaults to just 300 K.
            chempots (dict):
                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect
                formation energies (and thus concentrations). If ``None`` (default),
                will use ``self.defect_thermodynamics.chempots`` (= 0 for all
                chemical potentials by default).
                This can have the form of ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}], ...}``
                (the format generated by ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing
                functions (see tutorials)) and specific limits (chemical potential
                limits) can then be chosen using ``limit``.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (``limit``), in the format:
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases,
                in which case it is the formal chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the
                elemental references) that should be given here, otherwise the absolute
                (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.

                Note that you can also set ``FermiSolver.defect_thermodynamics.chempots = ...``
                or ``DefectThermodynamics.chempots = ...`` (with the same input options)
                to set the default chemical potentials for all calculations.
                (Default: None)
            limit (str):
                The chemical potential limit for which to calculate the Fermi level
                positions and defect/carrier concentrations. Can be either:

                - ``None``, if ``chempots`` corresponds to a single chemical potential
                  limit - otherwise will use the first chemical potential limit in the
                  ``chempots`` dict.
                - ``"X-rich"/"X-poor"`` where X is an element in the system, in which
                  case the most X-rich/poor limit will be used (e.g. "Li-rich").
                - A key in the ``(self.defect_thermodynamics.)chempots["limits"]``
                  dictionary.

                The latter two options can only be used if ``chempots`` is in the
                ``doped`` format (see chemical potentials tutorial).
                (Default: None)
            el_refs (dict):
                Dictionary of elemental reference energies for the chemical potentials
                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical
                potentials, when ``chempots`` has been manually specified as
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``). Unnecessary if ``chempots`` is
                provided/present in format generated by ``doped`` (see tutorials).

                Note that you can also set ``FermiSolver.defect_thermodynamics.el_refs = ...``
                or ``DefectThermodynamics.el_refs = ...`` (with the same input options)
                to set the default elemental reference energies for all calculations.
                (Default: None)
            effective_dopant_concentration (Optional[float]):
                The fixed concentration (in cm^-3) of an arbitrary dopant or
                impurity in the material. This value is included in the charge
                neutrality condition to analyze the Fermi level and doping
                response under hypothetical doping conditions.
                A positive value corresponds to donor doping, while a negative
                value corresponds to acceptor doping. For dopants of charge ``q``,
                the input value should be ``q * 'Dopant Concentration'``.
                Defaults to ``None``, corresponding to no additional extrinsic
                dopant.
            fixed_defects (Optional[dict[str, float]]):
                A dictionary of defect concentrations to fix regardless of
                chemical potentials / temperature / Fermi level, in the format:
                ``{defect_name: concentration}``, where ``defect_name`` is the
                name of a defect entry without (e.g. ``"v_O"``) or with (e.g.
                ``"v_O_+2"``) the charge state; which will then fix either the
                total concentration of that defect or only the concentration for
                the specified charge state.
                Concentrations should be given in cm^-3. This can be used to
                simulate the effect of a fixed impurity concentration.
                Defaults to ``None``.
            free_defects (Optional[list[str]]):
                A list of defects (without charge states) to be excluded from
                high-temperature concentration fixing. Useful for highly mobile
                defects that are not expected to be "frozen-in" upon quenching.
                Any defects whose names begin with a string in this list will be
                excluded from high-temperature concentration fixing (e.g. ``"v_"``
                will match all vacancy defects with ``doped``\-formatted names).
                Defaults to ``None``.
            fix_charge_states (bool):
                Whether to fix the concentrations of individual defect charge states
                (``True``) or allow charge states to vary while keeping total defect
                concentrations fixed (``False``) upon quenching. Not expected to be
                physically sensible in most cases. Defaults to ``False``.
            site_competition (bool | str):
                If ``True`` (default), uses the updated Fermi-Dirac-like formula for
                defect concentration, which accounts for defect site competition at high
                concentrations (see Kasamatsu et al. (10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.022)
                appendix for derivation -- updated here to additionally account for
                configurational degeneracies ``g`` (see https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E)),
                which gives the following defect concentration equation:
                ``N_X = N*[g*exp(-E/kT) / (1 + sum(g_i*exp(-E_i/kT)))]`` where ``i``
                runs over all defects which occupy the same site as the defect of interest.
                If ``False``, uses the standard dilute limit approximation.
                Alternatively ``site_competition`` can be set to a string (``"verbose"``),
                which will give the same behaviour as ``True`` as well as including the
                lattice site indices (used to determine which defects will compete for the
                same sites) in the output ``DataFrame``.
                Note that this option is only used if the ``doped`` backend is being used,
                not supported for the ``py-sc-fermi`` backend.

        Calculate the defect concentrations under a range of effective

        If ``annealing_temperature`` (and ``quenched_temperature``; 300 K by
        default) are specified, then the frozen defect approximation is
        employed, whereby total defect concentrations are calculated at the
        elevated annealing temperature, then fixed at these values (unless
        ``free_defects`` or ``fix_charge_states`` are specified) and the Fermi

        then the Fermi level and defect/carrier concentrations are calculated
        assuming thermodynamic equilibrium at that temperature.

        See ``(pseudo_)equilibrium_solve`` docstrings for more details.

        Args:
            effective_dopant_concentration_range (Union[float, list[float]]):
                The range of effective dopant concentrations to solve over.
                This can be a single value or a list of values representing
                different concentrations. These are taken as fixed
                concentrations (in cm^-3) of an arbitrary dopant or impurity
                in the material, included in the charge neutrality condition
                to analyze the Fermi level and doping response under
                hypothetical doping conditions.
                Positive values correspond to donor doping, while negative
                values correspond to acceptor doping. For dopants of charge ``q``,
                the input value should be ``q * 'Dopant Concentration'``.
            annealing_temperature (Optional[float]):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the high temperature
                (fixed) total defect concentrations, which should correspond to
                the highest temperature during annealing/synthesis of the material
                (at which we assume equilibrium defect concentrations) within the
                frozen defect approach. Default is ``None`` (uses ``temperature``
                under thermodynamic equilibrium).
            quenched_temperature (float):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the self-consistent
                (constrained equilibrium) Fermi level and carrier concentrations,
                given the fixed total concentrations, which should correspond to
                operating temperature of the material (typically room temperature).
                Default is 300 K.
            temperature (float):
                The temperature at which to solve for defect concentrations
                and Fermi level, under thermodynamic equilibrium (if
                ``annealing_temperature`` is not specified).
                Defaults to 300 K.
            chempots (dict):
                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect
                formation energies (and thus concentrations). If ``None`` (default),
                will use ``self.defect_thermodynamics.chempots`` (= 0 for all
                chemical potentials by default).
                This can have the form of ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}], ...}``
                (the format generated by ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing
                functions (see tutorials)) and specific limits (chemical potential
                limits) can then be chosen using ``limit``.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (``limit``), in the format:
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases,

                The chemical potential limit for which to calculate the Fermi level
                positions and defect/carrier concentrations. Can be either:

                - ``None``, if ``chempots`` corresponds to a single chemical potential
                  limit - otherwise will use the first chemical potential limit in the
                  ``chempots`` dict.
                - ``"X-rich"/"X-poor"`` where X is an element in the system, in which
                  case the most X-rich/poor limit will be used (e.g. "Li-rich").
                - A key in the ``(self.defect_thermodynamics.)chempots["limits"]``
                  dictionary.

                The latter two options can only be used if ``chempots`` is in the
                ``doped`` format (see chemical potentials tutorial).
                (Default: None)
            el_refs (dict):
                Dictionary of elemental reference energies for the chemical potentials
                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical
                potentials, when ``chempots`` has been manually specified as
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``). Unnecessary if ``chempots`` is
                provided/present in format generated by ``doped`` (see tutorials).

                Note that you can also set ``FermiSolver.defect_thermodynamics.el_refs = ...``
                or ``DefectThermodynamics.el_refs = ...`` (with the same input options)
                to set the default elemental reference energies for all calculations.
                (Default: None)
            fixed_defects (Optional[dict[str, float]]):
                A dictionary of defect concentrations to fix regardless of
                chemical potentials / temperature / Fermi level, in the format:
                ``{defect_name: concentration}``, where ``defect_name`` is the
                name of a defect entry without (e.g. ``"v_O"``) or with (e.g.
                ``"v_O_+2"``) the charge state; which will then fix either the
                total concentration of that defect or only the concentration for
                the specified charge state.
                Concentrations should be given in cm^-3. This can be used to
                simulate the effect of a fixed impurity concentration.
                Defaults to ``None``.
            free_defects (Optional[list[str]]):
                A list of defects (without charge states) to be excluded from
                high-temperature concentration fixing. Useful for highly mobile
                defects that are not expected to be "frozen-in" upon quenching.
                Any defects whose names begin with a string in this list will be
                excluded from high-temperature concentration fixing (e.g. ``"v_"``
                will match all vacancy defects with ``doped``\-formatted names).
                Defaults to ``None``.
            fix_charge_states (bool):
                Whether to fix the concentrations of individual defect charge states
                (``True``) or allow charge states to vary while keeping total defect
                concentrations fixed (``False``) upon quenching. Not expected to be
                physically sensible in most cases. Defaults to ``False``.
            site_competition (bool | str):
                If ``True`` (default), uses the updated Fermi-Dirac-like formula for
                defect concentration, which accounts for defect site competition at high
                concentrations (see Kasamatsu et al. (10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.022)
                appendix for derivation -- updated here to additionally account for
                configurational degeneracies ``g`` (see https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E)),
                which gives the following defect concentration equation:
                ``N_X = N*[g*exp(-E/kT) / (1 + sum(g_i*exp(-E_i/kT)))]`` where ``i``
                runs over all defects which occupy the same site as the defect of interest.
                If ``False``, uses the standard dilute limit approximation.
                Alternatively ``site_competition`` can be set to a string (``"verbose"``),
                which will give the same behaviour as ``True`` as well as including the
                lattice site indices (used to determine which defects will compete for the
                same sites) in the output ``DataFrame``.
                Note that this option is only used if the ``doped`` backend is being used,

        Interpolate between two sets of chemical potentials and solve for the
        defect concentrations and Fermi level at each interpolated point.

        Chemical potentials can be interpolated between two sets of chemical
        potential dictionaries/values, or between two specified limits.

        If ``annealing_temperature`` (and ``quenched_temperature``; 300 K by
        default) are specified, then the frozen defect approximation is
        employed, whereby total defect concentrations are calculated at the
        elevated annealing temperature, then fixed at these values (unless
        ``free_defects`` or ``fix_charge_states`` are specified) and the Fermi
        level and relative charge state populations are recalculated at the
        quenched temperature. Otherwise, if only ``temperature`` is specified,
        then the Fermi level and defect/carrier concentrations are calculated
        assuming thermodynamic equilibrium at that temperature.

        See ``(pseudo_)equilibrium_solve`` docstrings for more details.

        Args:
            n_points (int):
                The number of points to generate between chemical potential
                end points. Defaults to 10.
            chempots (Optional[list[dict]]):
                The chemical potentials to interpolate between. This can be
                either a list containing two dictionaries, each representing
                a set of chemical potentials for a single limit (in the format:
                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``) to interpolate between,
                or can be a single chemical potentials dictionary in the
                ``doped`` format (i.e. ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}], ...}``)
                -- in which case ``limits`` must be specified to pick the
                end-points to interpolate between.

                If ``None`` (default), will use ``self.defect_thermodynamics.chempots``.
                Note that you can also set
                ``FermiSolver.defect_thermodynamics.chempots = ...``
                or ``DefectThermodynamics.chempots = ...`` (with the same input
                options) to set the default chemical potentials for all calculations.

                If manually specifying chemical potentials with a list of two
                dictionaries, you can also set the ``el_refs`` option with the DFT
                reference energies of the elemental phases if desired, in which case
                it is the formal chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the elemental
                references) that should be given here, otherwise the absolute (DFT)
                chemical potentials should be given.
            limits (Optional[list[str]]):
                The chemical potential limits to interpolate between, as a list
                containing two strings. Each string should be in the format
                ``"X-rich"/"X-poor"``, where X is an element in the system, or
                be a key in the ``(self.defect_thermodynamics.)chempots["limits"]``
                dictionary.

                If not provided, ``chempots`` must be specified as a list of two
                single chemical potential dictionaries for single limits, or must be a
                binary system with only two limits in ``chempots``.
            el_refs (dict):
                Dictionary of elemental reference energies for the chemical potentials
                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical
                potentials, when ``chempots`` has been manually specified as
                ``[{element symbol: chemical potential}, ...]``). Unnecessary if

                or ``DefectThermodynamics.el_refs = ...`` (with the same input options)
                to set the default elemental reference energies for all calculations.
                (Default: None)
            annealing_temperature (Optional[float]):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the high temperature
                (fixed) total defect concentrations, which should correspond to
                the highest temperature during annealing/synthesis of the material
                (at which we assume equilibrium defect concentrations) within the
                frozen defect approach. Default is ``None`` (uses ``temperature``
                under thermodynamic equilibrium).
            quenched_temperature (float):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the self-consistent
                (constrained equilibrium) Fermi level and carrier concentrations,
                given the fixed total concentrations, which should correspond to
                operating temperature of the material (typically room temperature).
                Default is 300 K.
            temperature (float):
                The temperature at which to solve for defect concentrations
                and Fermi level, under thermodynamic equilibrium (if
                ``annealing_temperature`` is not specified).
                Defaults to 300 K.
            effective_dopant_concentration (Optional[float]):
                The fixed concentration (in cm^-3) of an arbitrary dopant or
                impurity in the material. This value is included in the charge
                neutrality condition to analyze the Fermi level and doping
                response under hypothetical doping conditions.
                A positive value corresponds to donor doping, while a negative
                value corresponds to acceptor doping. For dopants of charge ``q``,
                the input value should be ``q * 'Dopant Concentration'``.
                Defaults to ``None``, corresponding to no additional extrinsic
                dopant.
            fixed_defects (Optional[dict[str, float]]):
                A dictionary of defect concentrations to fix regardless of
                chemical potentials / temperature / Fermi level, in the format:
                ``{defect_name: concentration}``, where ``defect_name`` is the
                name of a defect entry without (e.g. ``"v_O"``) or with (e.g.
                ``"v_O_+2"``) the charge state; which will then fix either the
                total concentration of that defect or only the concentration for
                the specified charge state.
                Concentrations should be given in cm^-3. This can be used to
                simulate the effect of a fixed impurity concentration.
                Defaults to ``None``.
            free_defects (Optional[list[str]]):
                A list of defects (without charge states) to be excluded from
                high-temperature concentration fixing. Useful for highly mobile
                defects that are not expected to be "frozen-in" upon quenching.

                excluded from high-temperature concentration fixing (e.g. ``"v_"``
                will match all vacancy defects with ``doped``\-formatted names).
                Defaults to ``None``.
            fix_charge_states (bool):
                Whether to fix the concentrations of individual defect charge states
                (``True``) or allow charge states to vary while keeping total defect
                concentrations fixed (``False``) upon quenching. Not expected to be
                physically sensible in most cases. Defaults to ``False``.
            site_competition (bool | str):
                If ``True`` (default), uses the updated Fermi-Dirac-like formula for
                defect concentration, which accounts for defect site competition at high
                concentrations (see Kasamatsu et al. (10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.022)
                appendix for derivation -- updated here to additionally account for

                which gives the following defect concentration equation:
                ``N_X = N*[g*exp(-E/kT) / (1 + sum(g_i*exp(-E_i/kT)))]`` where ``i``
                runs over all defects which occupy the same site as the defect of interest.

        Scan over a range of chemical potentials and solve for the defect
        concentrations and Fermi level at each set of chemical potentials.

        Note that this function only solves for the Fermi level and
        defect/carrier concentrations `at the given chemical potentials`
        (and not at any points between them), whereas
        ``scan_chemical_potential_grid``, ``interpolate_chempots`` and
        ``optimise`` scan over the grid/points between chemical potential
        limits, which may be desired.

        If ``annealing_temperature`` (and ``quenched_temperature``; 300 K by
        default) are specified, then the frozen defect approximation is
        employed, whereby total defect concentrations are calculated at the
        elevated annealing temperature, then fixed at these values (unless
        ``free_defects`` or ``fix_charge_states`` are specified) and the Fermi
        level and relative charge state populations are recalculated at the
        quenched temperature. Otherwise, if only ``temperature`` is specified,
        then the Fermi level and defect/carrier concentrations are calculated
        assuming thermodynamic equilibrium at that temperature.

        See ``(pseudo_)equilibrium_solve`` docstrings for more details.

        Args:
            chempots (Optional[Union[list[dict], dict]]):
                The chemical potentials to scan over. This can be either a list
                containing dictionaries of a set of chemical potentials for a
                `single` limit (in the format: ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``),
                or can be a single chemical potentials dictionary in the
                ``doped`` format (i.e. ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}], ...}``)
                -- in which case ``limits`` can be specified to pick the chemical
                potential limits to scan over (otherwise scans over all limits in the
                ``chempots`` dictionary).

                If ``None`` (default), will use ``self.defect_thermodynamics.chempots``.
                Note that you can also set
                ``FermiSolver.defect_thermodynamics.chempots = ...``
                or ``DefectThermodynamics.chempots = ...`` (with the same input
                options) to set the default chemical potentials for all calculations.

                If manually specifying chemical potentials with a list of dictionaries,
                you can also set the ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies
                of the elemental phases if desired, in which case it is the formal
                chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the elemental references) that
                should be given here, otherwise the absolute (DFT) chemical potentials
                should be given.
            limits (Optional[list[str]]):
                The chemical potential limits to scan over, as a list of strings, if
                ``chempots`` was provided / is present in the ``doped`` format. Each
                string should be in the format ``"X-rich"/"X-poor"``, where X is an
                element in the system, or be a key in the
                ``(self.defect_thermodynamics.)chempots["limits"]`` dictionary.

                If ``None`` (default) and ``chempots`` is in the ``doped`` format
                (rather than a list of single chemical potential limits), will scan
                over all limits in the ``chempots`` dictionary.
            el_refs (dict):
                Dictionary of elemental reference energies for the chemical potentials
                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical
                potentials, when ``chempots`` has been manually specified as
                ``[{element symbol: chemical potential}, ...]``). Unnecessary if
                ``chempots`` is provided/present in format generated by ``doped``
                (i.e. ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}], ...}``).

                Note that you can also set ``FermiSolver.defect_thermodynamics.el_refs = ...``
                or ``DefectThermodynamics.el_refs = ...`` (with the same input options)
                to set the default elemental reference energies for all calculations.
                (Default: None)
            annealing_temperature (Optional[float]):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the high temperature
                (fixed) total defect concentrations, which should correspond to
                the highest temperature during annealing/synthesis of the material
                (at which we assume equilibrium defect concentrations) within the
                frozen defect approach. Default is ``None`` (uses ``temperature``
                under thermodynamic equilibrium).
            quenched_temperature (float):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the self-consistent
                (constrained equilibrium) Fermi level and carrier concentrations,
                given the fixed total concentrations, which should correspond to
                operating temperature of the material (typically room temperature).
                Default is 300 K.
            temperature (float):
                The temperature at which to solve for defect concentrations
                and Fermi level, under thermodynamic equilibrium (if
                ``annealing_temperature`` is not specified).
                Defaults to 300 K.
            effective_dopant_concentration (Optional[float]):
                The fixed concentration (in cm^-3) of an arbitrary dopant or
                impurity in the material. This value is included in the charge
                neutrality condition to analyze the Fermi level and doping
                response under hypothetical doping conditions.
                A positive value corresponds to donor doping, while a negative
                value corresponds to acceptor doping. For dopants of charge ``q``,
                the input value should be ``q * 'Dopant Concentration'``.
                Defaults to ``None``, corresponding to no additional extrinsic
                dopant.
            fixed_defects (Optional[dict[str, float]]):
                A dictionary of defect concentrations to fix regardless of
                chemical potentials / temperature / Fermi level, in the format:
                ``{defect_name: concentration}``, where ``defect_name`` is the
                name of a defect entry without (e.g. ``"v_O"``) or with (e.g.
                ``"v_O_+2"``) the charge state; which will then fix either the
                total concentration of that defect or only the concentration for
                the specified charge state.
                Concentrations should be given in cm^-3. This can be used to
                simulate the effect of a fixed impurity concentration.
                Defaults to ``None``.
            free_defects (Optional[list[str]]):
                A list of defects (without charge states) to be excluded from
                high-temperature concentration fixing. Useful for highly mobile
                defects that are not expected to be "frozen-in" upon quenching.
                Any defects whose names begin with a string in this list will be
                excluded from high-temperature concentration fixing (e.g. ``"v_"``
                will match all vacancy defects with ``doped``\-formatted names).
                Defaults to ``None``.
            fix_charge_states (bool):
                Whether to fix the concentrations of individual defect charge states
                (``True``) or allow charge states to vary while keeping total defect
                concentrations fixed (``False``) upon quenching. Not expected to be
                physically sensible in most cases. Defaults to ``False``.
            site_competition (bool | str):
                If ``True`` (default), uses the updated Fermi-Dirac-like formula for
                defect concentration, which accounts for defect site competition at high
                concentrations (see Kasamatsu et al. (10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.022)
                appendix for derivation -- updated here to additionally account for
                configurational degeneracies ``g`` (see https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E)),
                which gives the following defect concentration equation:
                ``N_X = N*[g*exp(-E/kT) / (1 + sum(g_i*exp(-E_i/kT)))]`` where ``i``
                runs over all defects which occupy the same site as the defect of interest.
                If ``False``, uses the standard dilute limit approximation.
                Alternatively ``site_competition`` can be set to a string (``"verbose"``),
                which will give the same behaviour as ``True`` as well as including the
                lattice site indices (used to determine which defects will compete for the
                same sites) in the output ``DataFrame``.
                Note that this option is only used if the ``doped`` backend is being used,

        r"""
        Search for the chemical potentials that minimise or maximise a target
        variable, such as electron concentration, within a specified tolerance.

        See ``target`` argument description below for valid choices. This function
        iterates over a grid of chemical potentials and "zooms in" on the chemical
        potential that either minimises or maximises the target variable. The
        process continues until the _relative_ change in the target variable is
        less than the specified tolerance.

        If ``annealing_temperature`` (and ``quenched_temperature``; 300 K by
        default) are specified, then the frozen defect approximation is
        employed, whereby total defect concentrations are calculated at the
        elevated annealing temperature, then fixed at these values (unless
        ``free_defects`` or ``fix_charge_states`` are specified) and the Fermi
        level and relative charge state populations are recalculated at the
        quenched temperature. Otherwise, if only ``temperature`` is specified,
        then the Fermi level and defect/carrier concentrations are calculated
        assuming thermodynamic equilibrium at that temperature.

        See ``(pseudo_)equilibrium_solve`` docstrings for more details.

        Args:
            target (str):
                The target variable to minimise or maximise, e.g., "Electrons",
                "Te_i", "Fermi Level" etc. Valid ``target`` values are column names (or
                substrings), such as 'Electrons', 'Holes', 'Fermi Level', 'μ_X', etc.,
                or defect names (without charge states), such as 'v_O', 'Te_i', etc.
                If a full defect name is given (e.g. Te_i_Td_Te2.83) then the
                concentration of that defect will be used as the target variable. If
                a defect name substring is given instead (e.g. Te_i), then the target
                variable will be the summed concentration of all defects with that
                substring in their name (e.g. Te_i_Td_Te2.83, Te_i_C3v etc).
            min_or_max (str):
                Specify whether to "minimise" ("min") or "maximise" ("max"; default)
                the target variable.
            chempots (Optional[dict]):
                Dictionary of chemical potentials to scan over, in the ``doped``
                format (i.e. ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}], ...}``)
                -- the format generated by ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing
                functions (see tutorials).

                If ``None`` (default), will use ``self.defect_thermodynamics.chempots``.

                Note that you can also set
                ``FermiSolver.defect_thermodynamics.chempots = ...`` or
                ``DefectThermodynamics.chempots = ...`` to set the default chemical
                potentials for all calculations, and you can set
                ``FermiSolver.defect_thermodynamics.el_refs = ...`` or
                ``DefectThermodynamics.el_refs = ...`` if you want to update the
                elemental reference energies for any reason.
            annealing_temperature (Optional[float]):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the high temperature
                (fixed) total defect concentrations, which should correspond to
                the highest temperature during annealing/synthesis of the material
                (at which we assume equilibrium defect concentrations) within the
                frozen defect approach. Default is ``None`` (uses ``temperature``
                under thermodynamic equilibrium).
            quenched_temperature (float):
                Temperature in Kelvin at which to calculate the self-consistent
                (constrained equilibrium) Fermi level and carrier concentrations,
                given the fixed total concentrations, which should correspond to
                operating temperature of the material (typically room temperature).
                Default is 300 K.
            temperature (float):
                The temperature at which to solve for defect concentrations
                and Fermi level, under thermodynamic equilibrium (if
                ``annealing_temperature`` is not specified).
                Defaults to 300 K.
            tolerance (float):
                The convergence criterion for the target variable. The search
                stops when the relative change in the target value is less than
                this value. Defaults to ``0.01``.
            n_points (int):
                The number of points to generate along each axis of the chemical
                potentials grid for each iteration of the search. The higher the
                dimension of your chemical system (i.e. number of elements), the
                more sensitive the runtime will be to the choice of ``n_points``.
                Defaults to ``10``.
            effective_dopant_concentration (Optional[float]):
                The fixed concentration (in cm^-3) of an arbitrary dopant or
                impurity in the material. This value is included in the charge
                neutrality condition to analyze the Fermi level and doping
                response under hypothetical doping conditions.
                A positive value corresponds to donor doping, while a negative
                value corresponds to acceptor doping. For dopants of charge ``q``,
                the input value should be ``q * 'Dopant Concentration'``.
                Defaults to ``None``, corresponding to no additional extrinsic
                dopant.
            fixed_defects (Optional[dict[str, float]]):
                A dictionary of defect concentrations to fix regardless of
                chemical potentials / temperature / Fermi level, in the format:
                ``{defect_name: concentration}``, where ``defect_name`` is the
                name of a defect entry without (e.g. ``"v_O"``) or with (e.g.
                ``"v_O_+2"``) the charge state; which will then fix either the
                total concentration of that defect or only the concentration for
                the specified charge state.
                Concentrations should be given in cm^-3. This can be used to
                simulate the effect of a fixed impurity concentration.
                Defaults to ``None``.
            free_defects (Optional[list[str]]):
                A list of defects (without charge states) to be excluded from
                high-temperature concentration fixing. Useful for highly mobile
                defects that are not expected to be "frozen-in" upon quenching.
                Any defects whose names begin with a string in this list will be
                excluded from high-temperature concentration fixing (e.g. ``"v_"``
                will match all vacancy defects with ``doped``\-formatted names).
                Defaults to ``None``.
            fix_charge_states (bool):
                Whether to fix the concentrations of individual defect charge states
                (``True``) or allow charge states to vary while keeping total defect
                concentrations fixed (``False``) upon quenching. Not expected to be
                physically sensible in most cases. Defaults to ``False``.
            site_competition (bool | str):
                If ``True`` (default), uses the updated Fermi-Dirac-like formula for
                defect concentration, which accounts for defect site competition at high
                concentrations (see Kasamatsu et al. (10.1016/j.ssi.2010.11.022)
                appendix for derivation -- updated here to additionally account for
                configurational degeneracies ``g`` (see https://doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E)),
                which gives the following defect concentration equation:
                ``N_X = N*[g*exp(-E/kT) / (1 + sum(g_i*exp(-E_i/kT)))]`` where ``i``
                runs over all defects which occupy the same site as the defect of interest.
                If ``False``, uses the standard dilute limit approximation.
                Alternatively ``site_competition`` can be set to a string (``"verbose"``),
                which will give the same behaviour as ``True`` as well as including the
                lattice site indices (used to determine which defects will compete for the
                same sites) in the output ``DataFrame``.
                Note that this option is only used if the ``doped`` backend is being used,
                not supported for the ``py-sc-fermi`` backend.

        Returns:
            pd.DataFrame:
                A ``DataFrame`` containing the results of the minimisation or
                maximisation process, including the optimal chemical potentials and
                the corresponding values of the target variable.

                ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If ``el_refs`` is provided or set in
                ``self.defect_thermodynamics.el_refs`` then it is the `formal`
                chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the elemental reference
                energies) that should be given here, otherwise the absolute
                (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.
            el_refs (dict[str, float]):
                Dictionary of elemental reference energies for the chemical
                potentials in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}``. Unnecessary if
                ``self.defect_thermodynamics.el_refs`` is set (i.e. if
                ``chempots`` was provided to ``self.defect_thermodynamics`` in
                the format generated by ``doped``).
                (Default: None)
            quenched_temperature (float):
                The lower temperature (in Kelvin) to which the system is
                quenched. Defaults to 300 K.
            effective_dopant_concentration (Optional[float]):
                The fixed concentration (in cm^-3) of an arbitrary
                dopant/impurity in the material. A positive value indicates
                donor doping, while a negative value indicates acceptor doping.
                For dopants of charge ``q``, the input value should be
                ``q * 'Dopant Concentration'``.
                Defaults to ``None``, corresponding to no extrinsic dopant.
            fixed_defects (Optional[dict[str, float]]):
                A dictionary of defect concentrations to fix at the quenched
                temperature, in the format: ``{defect_name: concentration}``,
                where ``defect_name`` is the name of a defect entry without
                (e.g. ``"v_O"``) or with (e.g. ``"v_O_+2"``) the charge state;
                which will then fix either the total concentration of that defect
                or only the concentration for the specified charge state.
                Concentrations should be given in cm^-3. This can be used to fix
                the concentrations of specific defects regardless of the chemical
                potentials, or anneal-quench procedure (e.g. to simulate the effect
                of a fixed impurity concentration).
            free_defects (Optional[list[str]]):
                A list of defects (without charge states) to be excluded from
                high-temperature concentration fixing. Useful for highly mobile
                defects that are not expected to be "frozen-in" upon quenching.
                Any defects whose names begin with a string in this list will be
                excluded from high-temperature concentration fixing (e.g. ``"v_"``
                will match all vacancy defects with ``doped``\-formatted names).
                Defaults to ``None``.
            fix_charge_states (bool):
                Whether to fix the concentrations of individual defect charge
                states (``True``) or allow charge states to vary while keeping
                total defect concentrations fixed (``False``).
                Defaults to ``False``.
