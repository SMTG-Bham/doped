        Parses the charge transition levels for defect entries in the
        DefectThermodynamics object, and stores information about the stable
        charge states, transition levels etc.

        Defect entries of the same type (e.g. ``Te_i``, ``v_Cd``) are grouped together
        (for plotting and transition level analysis) based on the minimum
        distance between (equivalent) defect sites, to distinguish between
        different inequivalent sites. ``DefectEntry``\s of the same type and with
        a closest distance between equivalent defect sites less than ``dist_tol``
        (1.5 Å by default) are grouped together. If a DefectEntry's site has a
        closest distance less than ``dist_tol`` to multiple sets of equivalent
        sites, then it is matched to the one with the lowest minimum distance.

        Code for parsing the transition levels was originally templated from
        the pyCDT (pymatgen<=2022.7.25) thermodynamics code (deleted in later
        versions).

        This function uses scipy's HalfspaceIntersection
        to construct the polygons corresponding to defect stability as
        a function of the Fermi-level. The Halfspace Intersection
        constructs N-dimensional hyperplanes, in this case N=2, based
        on the equation of defect formation energy with considering chemical
        potentials:
            E_form = E_0^{Corrected} + Q_{defect}*(E_{VBM} + E_{Fermi}).

        Extra hyperplanes are constructed to bound this space so that
        the algorithm can actually find enclosed region.

        This code was modeled after the Halfspace Intersection code for
        the Pourbaix Diagram.

                (default: True)
            per_site (bool):
                Whether to return the concentrations as fractional concentrations per site,

        Calculate the self-consistent Fermi level, at a given chemical
        potential limit and temperature, assuming `equilibrium` defect
        concentrations (i.e. under annealing) and the dilute limit
        approximation, by self-consistently solving for the Fermi level which
        yields charge neutrality.

        Note that this assumes `equilibrium` defect concentrations!
        DefectThermodynamics.get_quenched_fermi_level_and_concentrations() can
        instead be used to calculate the Fermi level and defect concentrations
        for a material grown/annealed at higher temperatures and then cooled
        (quenched) to room/operating temperature (where defect concentrations
        are assumed to remain fixed) - this is known as the frozen defect
        approach and is typically the most valid approximation (see its
        docstring for more information).

        Note that the bulk DOS calculation should be well-converged with respect to
        k-points for accurate Fermi level predictions!
        Note: For dense k-point DOS calculations, loading the vasprun.xml(.gz) file
        can be the most time-consuming part of this function, so if you are running
        this function multiple times, it is faster to initialise the FermiDos object
        yourself (and set ``nelecs`` appropriately - important!), and set ``bulk_dos_vr``
        to this object instead.

        The degeneracy/multiplicity factor "g" is an important parameter in the defect
        concentration equation and thus Fermi level calculation (see discussion in
        doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00043A and doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E), affecting the
        final concentration by up to 2 orders of magnitude. This factor is taken from
        the product of the defect_entry.defect.multiplicity and
        defect_entry.degeneracy_factors attributes.

        Args:
            bulk_dos_vr (str or Vasprun or FermiDos):
                Path to the vasprun.xml(.gz) output of a bulk electronic density of states
                (DOS) calculation, or the corresponding pymatgen Vasprun object. Usually
                this is a static calculation with the `primitive` cell of the bulk, with
                relatively dense k-point sampling (especially for materials with disperse
                band edges) to ensure an accurately-converged DOS and thus Fermi level.
                ISMEAR = -5 (tetrahedron smearing) is usually recommended for best
                convergence. Consistent functional settings should be used for the bulk
                DOS and defect supercell calculations.
                Alternatively, a pymatgen FermiDos object can be supplied directly (e.g.
                in case you are using a DFT code other than VASP).

                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect

                If ``None`` (default), will use ``self.chempots`` (= 0 for all chemical
                potentials by default).
                This can have the form of ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}]}``
                (the format generated by ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing
                functions (see tutorials)) and specific limits (chemical potential
                limits) can then be chosen using ``limit``.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (limit), in the format: ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases,
                in which case it is the formal chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the
                elemental references) that should be given here, otherwise the absolute
                (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.
            limit (str):
                The chemical potential limit for which to
                determine the equilibrium Fermi level. Can be either:

                - ``None``, if ``chempots`` corresponds to a single chemical potential
                  limit - otherwise will use the first chemical potential limit in the
                  ``chempots`` dict.
                - ``"X-rich"/"X-poor"`` where X is an element in the system, in which
                  case the most X-rich/poor limit will be used (e.g. "Li-rich").
                - A key in the ``(self.)chempots["limits"]`` dictionary.

                The latter two options can only be used if ``chempots`` is in the
                ``doped`` format (see chemical potentials tutorial).
                (Default: None)
            el_refs (dict):

                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical
                potentials, when ``chempots`` has been manually specified as

        Calculate the self-consistent Fermi level and corresponding
        carrier/defect calculations, for a given chemical potential limit,
        annealing temperature and quenched/operating temperature, using the
        frozen defect and dilute limit approximations under the constraint of
        charge neutrality.

        According to the 'frozen defect' approximation, we typically expect defect
        concentrations to reach equilibrium during annealing/crystal growth
        (at elevated temperatures), but `not` upon quenching (i.e. at
        room/operating temperature) where we expect kinetic inhibition of defect
        annhiliation and hence non-equilibrium defect concentrations / Fermi level.
        Typically this is approximated by computing the equilibrium Fermi level and
        defect concentrations at the annealing temperature, and then assuming the
        total concentration of each defect is fixed to this value, but that the
        relative populations of defect charge states (and the Fermi level) can
        re-equilibrate at the lower (room) temperature. See discussion in
        doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E (brief), doi.org/10.1016/j.cpc.2019.06.017 (detailed)
        and ``doped``/``py-sc-fermi`` tutorials for more information.
        In certain cases (such as Li-ion battery materials or extremely slow charge
        capture/emission), these approximations may have to be adjusted such that some
        defects/charge states are considered fixed and some are allowed to
        re-equilibrate (e.g. highly mobile Li vacancies/interstitials). Modelling
        these specific cases is demonstrated in:
        py-sc-fermi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial.html#3.-Applying-concentration-constraints

        This function works by calculating the self-consistent Fermi level and total
        concentration of each defect at the annealing temperature, then fixing the
        total concentrations to these values and re-calculating the self-consistent
        (constrained equilibrium) Fermi level and relative charge state concentrations
        under this constraint at the quenched/operating temperature.

        Note that the bulk DOS calculation should be well-converged with respect to
        k-points for accurate Fermi level predictions!
        Note: For dense k-point DOS calculations, loading the vasprun.xml(.gz) file
        can be the most time-consuming part of this function, so if you are running
        this function multiple times, it is faster to initialise the FermiDos object
        yourself (and set ``nelecs`` appropriately - important!), and set ``bulk_dos_vr``
        to this object instead.

        The degeneracy/multiplicity factor "g" is an important parameter in the defect
        concentration equation and thus Fermi level calculation (see discussion in
        doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00043A and doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E), affecting the
        final concentration by up to 2 orders of magnitude. This factor is taken from
        the product of the defect_entry.defect.multiplicity and
        defect_entry.degeneracy_factors attributes.

        Find the doping windows of the defect system, searching over all limits
        (chemical potential limits) in ``chempots`` and returning the most

        ``limit`` is set or ``chempots`` corresponds to a single chemical
        potential limit; i.e. {element symbol: chemical potential}).

        Doping window is defined by the formation energy of the lowest energy
        compensating defect species at the corresponding band edge (i.e. VBM for
        hole doping and CBM for electron doping), as these set the upper limit to
        the formation energy of dopants which could push the Fermi level close to
        the band edge without being negated by defect charge compensation.

        If a dopant has a higher formation energy than the doping window at the
        band edge, then its charge will be compensated by formation of the
        corresponding limiting defect species (rather than free carrier populations).

        Args:
            chempots (dict):
                Dictionary of chemical potentials to use for calculating the defect
                formation energies (and thus doping windows).
                If ``None`` (default), will use ``self.chempots``.
                This can have the form of ``{"limits": [{'limit': [chempot_dict]}]}``
                (the format generated by ``doped``\'s chemical potential parsing
                functions (see tutorials)) and specific limits (chemical potential
                limits) can then be chosen using ``limit``.

                Alternatively this can be a dictionary of chemical potentials for a
                single limit (limit), in the format: ``{element symbol: chemical potential}``.
                If manually specifying chemical potentials this way, you can set the
                ``el_refs`` option with the DFT reference energies of the elemental phases,
                in which case it is the formal chemical potentials (i.e. relative to the
                elemental references) that should be given here, otherwise the absolute
                (DFT) chemical potentials should be given.
            limit (str):
                The chemical potential limit for which to
                calculate formation energies (and thus doping windows). Can be either:

                - ``None``, in which case we search over all limits (chemical potential
                  limits) in ``chempots`` and return the most n/p-type conditions,
                  unless ``chempots`` corresponds to a single chemical potential limit.
                - ``"X-rich"/"X-poor"`` where X is an element in the system, in which
                  case the most X-rich/poor limit will be used (e.g. "Li-rich").
                - A key in the ``(self.)chempots["limits"]`` dictionary.

                The latter two options can only be used if ``chempots`` is in the

                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical

                - A key in the ``(self.)chempots["limits"]`` dictionary.

                The latter two options can only be used if ``chempots`` is in the
                ``doped`` format (see chemical potentials tutorial).

                in the format:
                ``{element symbol: reference energy}`` (to determine the formal chemical

                self.defect_entries if present, otherwise self.vbm.
                If None (default), set to the mid-gap Fermi level (E_g/2).
            skip_formatting (bool):
                Whether to skip formatting the defect charge states as

        Generates a table of the bulk-site & relaxed defect point group
        symmetries, spin/orientational/total degeneracies and (bulk-)site
        multiplicities for each defect in the ``DefectThermodynamics`` object.

        Table Key:

        - 'Defect': Defect name (without charge)
        - 'q': Defect charge state.
        - 'Site_Symm': Point group symmetry of the defect site in the bulk cell.
        - 'Defect_Symm': Point group symmetry of the relaxed defect.
        - 'g_Orient': Orientational degeneracy of the defect.
        - 'g_Spin': Spin degeneracy of the defect.
        - 'g_Total': Total degeneracy of the defect.
        - 'Mult': Multiplicity of the defect site in the bulk cell, per primitive unit cell.

        For interstitials, the bulk site symmetry corresponds to the
        point symmetry of the interstitial site with `no relaxation
        of the host structure`, while for vacancies/substitutions it is
        simply the symmetry of their corresponding bulk site.
        This corresponds to the point symmetry of ``DefectEntry.defect``,
        or ``calculation_metadata["bulk_site"]/["unrelaxed_defect_structure"]``.

        Point group symmetries are taken from the calculation_metadata
        ("relaxed point symmetry" and "bulk site symmetry") if
        present (should be, if parsed with doped and defect supercell
        doesn't break host periodicity), otherwise are attempted to be
        recalculated.

        Note: doped tries to use the defect_entry.defect_supercell to determine
        the `relaxed` site symmetry. However, it should be noted that this is not
        guaranteed to work in all cases; namely for non-diagonal supercell
        expansions, or sometimes for non-scalar supercell expansion matrices
        (e.g. a 2x1x2 expansion)(particularly with high-symmetry materials)
        which can mess up the periodicity of the cell. doped tries to automatically
        check if this is the case, and will warn you if so.

        This can also be checked by using this function on your doped `generated` defects:

        .. code-block:: python

            from doped.generation import get_defect_name_from_entry
            for defect_name, defect_entry in defect_gen.items():
                print(defect_name, get_defect_name_from_entry(defect_entry, relaxed=False),
                      get_defect_name_from_entry(defect_entry), "\n")

        And if the point symmetries match in each case, then doped should be able to
        correctly determine the final relaxed defect symmetry (and orientational degeneracy)
        - otherwise periodicity-breaking prevents this.

        If periodicity-breaking prevents auto-symmetry determination, you can manually
        determine the relaxed defect and bulk-site point symmetries, and/or orientational
        degeneracy, from visualising the structures (e.g. using VESTA)(can use
        ``get_orientational_degeneracy`` to obtain the corresponding orientational
        degeneracy factor for given defect/bulk-site point symmetries) and setting the
        corresponding values in the
        ``calculation_metadata['relaxed point symmetry']/['bulk site symmetry']`` and/or
        ``degeneracy_factors['orientational degeneracy']`` attributes.
        Note that the bulk-site point symmetry corresponds to that of ``DefectEntry.defect``,
        or equivalently ``calculation_metadata["bulk_site"]/["unrelaxed_defect_structure"]``,
        which for vacancies/substitutions is the symmetry of the corresponding bulk site,
        while for interstitials it is the point symmetry of the `final relaxed` interstitial
        site when placed in the (unrelaxed) bulk structure.
        The degeneracy factor is used in the calculation of defect/carrier concentrations
        and Fermi level behaviour (see e.g. doi.org/10.1039/D2FD00043A &
        doi.org/10.1039/D3CS00432E).
