        Generates pymatgen DefectEntry objects for defects in the input host structure.
        By default, generates all intrinsic defects, but extrinsic defects (impurities)
        can also be created using the `extrinsic` argument.

        Interstitial sites are generated using Voronoi tesselation by default (found
        to be the most reliable), however these can also be manually specified using
        the `interstitial_coords` argument.

        Supercells are generated for each defect using the pymatgen `get_supercell_structure()`
        method, with `doped` default settings of `min_length = 10` (minimum supercell length
        of 10 â„«) and `min_atoms = 50` (minimum 50 atoms in supercell). If a different supercell
        is desired, this can be controlled by specifying keyword arguments in DefectsGenerator(),
        which are passed to the `get_supercell_structure()` method.

        Generated defect entries are named (by setting the `DefectEntry.name` attribute) as
        "{DefectEntry.defect.name}_m{DefectEntry.defect.multiplicity}_{charge}" for interstitials
        and "{DefectEntry.defect.name}_s{DefectEntry.defect.defect_site_index}_{charge}" for
        vacancies and antisites/substitutions. The labels "a", "b", "c"... will be appended for
        defects with multiple inequivalent sites.

                primitive cell for defect generation, before supercell generation.

                List or dict of elements to be used for extrinsic defect generation
                (i.e. dopants/impurities). If a list is provided, all possible
                substitutional defects for each extrinsic element will be generated.
                If a dict is provided, the keys should be the host elements to be
                substituted, and the values the extrinsic element(s) to substitute in;
                as a string or list.
                In both cases, all possible extrinsic interstitials are generated.
