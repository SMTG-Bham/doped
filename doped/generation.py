        Generates pymatgen DefectEntry objects for defects in the input host structure.
        By default, generates all intrinsic defects, but extrinsic defects (impurities)
        can also be created using the `extrinsic` argument.

        Interstitial sites are generated using Voronoi tesselation by default (found
        to be the most reliable), however these can also be manually specified using
        the `interstitial_coords` argument.

        Supercells are generated for each defect using the pymatgen `get_supercell_structure()`
        method, with `doped` default settings of `min_length = 10` (minimum supercell length
        of 10 â„«) and `min_atoms = 50` (minimum 50 atoms in supercell). If a different supercell
        is desired, this can be controlled by specifying keyword arguments in DefectsGenerator(),
        which are passed to the `get_supercell_structure()` method.

        # TODO: Describe naming scheme here

        # TODO: Mention how charge states are generated, and how to modify, as shown in the example notebook.
        # Also show how to remove certain defects from the dictionary? Mightn't be worth the space for this though
        # TODO: Add option to not reduce the structure to the primitive cell, and just use the input structure as
        # the bulk supercell, in case the user doesn't want to generate the supercell with `pymatgen`. In this case,
        # warn the user that this might take a while, especially for interstitials in low-symmetry systems. Add note
        # to docs that if for some reason this is the case, the user could use a modified version of the pymatgen
        # interstitial finding tools directly along with multi-processing

        Args:
            structure (Structure):
                Structure of the host material (as a pymatgen Structure object).
                If this is not the primitive unit cell, it will be reduced to the
                primitive cell for defect generation, before supercell generation.
            extrinsic (Union[str, List, Dict]):
                List or dict of elements (or string for single element) to be used
                for extrinsic defect generation (i.e. dopants/impurities). If a
                list is provided, all possible substitutional defects for each
                extrinsic element will be generated. If a dict is provided, the keys
                should be the host elements to be substituted, and the values the
                extrinsic element(s) to substitute in; as a string or list.
                In both cases, all possible extrinsic interstitials are generated.
            interstitial_coords (List):
                List of fractional coordinates (in the primitive cell) to use as
                interstitial defect sites. Default (when interstitial_coords not
                specified) is to automatically generate interstitial sites using
                Voronoi tesselation.
