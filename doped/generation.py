        Generates doped DefectEntry objects for defects in the input host
        structure. By default, generates all intrinsic defects, but extrinsic
        defects (impurities) can also be created using the `extrinsic`
        argument.

        Interstitial sites are generated using Voronoi tessellation by default (found
        to be the most reliable), which can be controlled using the
        `interstitial_gen_kwargs` argument (passed as keyword arguments to the
        `VoronoiInterstitialGenerator` class). Alternatively, a list of interstitial
        sites can be manually specified using the `interstitial_coords` argument.

        By default, supercells are generated for each defect using the pymatgen
        `get_supercell_structure()` method, with `doped` default settings of
        `min_length = 10` (minimum supercell length of 10 Å) and `min_atoms = 50`
        (minimum 50 atoms in supercell). If a different supercell is desired, this
        can be controlled by specifying keyword arguments with `supercell_gen_kwargs`,
        which are passed to the `get_sc_fromstruct()` function.
        Alternatively if `generate_supercell = False`, then no supercell is generated
        and the input structure is used as the defect & bulk supercell.

        The algorithm for determining defect entry names is to use the pymatgen defect
        name (e.g. v_Cd, Cd_Te etc.) for vacancies/antisites/substitutions, unless
        there are multiple inequivalent sites for the defect, in which case the point
        group of the defect site is appended (e.g. v_Cd_Td, Cd_Te_Td etc.), and if
        this is still not unique, then element identity and distance to the nearest
        neighbour of the defect site is appended (e.g. v_Cd_Td_Te2.83, Cd_Te_Td_Cd2.83
        etc.). For interstitials, the same naming scheme is used, but the point group
        is always appended to the pymatgen defect name.

        Possible charge states for the defects are estimated using the probability of
        the corresponding defect element oxidation state, the magnitude of the charge
        state, and the maximum magnitude of the host oxidation states (i.e. how
        'charged' the host is), with large (absolute) charge states, low probability
        oxidation states and/or greater charge/oxidation state magnitudes than that of
        the host being disfavoured. This can be controlled using the
        `probability_threshold` or `padding` keys in the `charge_state_gen_kwargs`
        parameter, which are passed to the `_charge_state_probability()` function.
        The input and computed values used to guess charge state probabilities are
        provided in the `DefectEntry.charge_state_guessing_log` attributes.
        See docs for examples of modifying the generated charge states.

        Args:
            structure (Structure):
                Structure of the host material (as a pymatgen Structure object).
                If this is not the primitive unit cell, it will be reduced to the
                primitive cell for defect generation, before supercell generation.
            extrinsic (Union[str, List, Dict]):
                List or dict of elements (or string for single element) to be used
                for extrinsic defect generation (i.e. dopants/impurities). If a
                list is provided, all possible substitutional defects for each
                extrinsic element will be generated. If a dict is provided, the keys
                should be the host elements to be substituted, and the values the
                extrinsic element(s) to substitute in; as a string or list.
                In both cases, all possible extrinsic interstitials are generated.
            interstitial_coords (List):
                List of fractional coordinates (in the primitive cell) to use as
                interstitial defect sites. Default (when interstitial_coords not
                specified) is to automatically generate interstitial sites using
                Voronoi tessellation.
            generate_supercell (bool):
                Whether to generate a supercell for the output defect entries
                (using pymatgen's `CubicSupercellTransformation` and ASE's
                `find_optimal_cell_shape()` functions) or not. If False, then the
                input structure is used as the defect & bulk supercell.
            charge_state_gen_kwargs (Dict):
                Keyword arguments to be passed to the `_charge_state_probability`
                function (such as `probability_threshold` (default = 0.01, used for
                substitutions and interstitials) and `padding` (default = 1, used for
                vacancies)) to control defect charge state generation.
            supercell_gen_kwargs (Dict):
                Keyword arguments to be passed to the `get_sc_fromstruct` function
                in `pymatgen.analysis.defects.supercells` (such as `min_atoms`
                (default = 50), `max_atoms` (default = 500), `min_length` (default
                = 10), and `force_diagonal` (default = False)).
            interstitial_gen_kwargs (Dict):
                Keyword arguments to be passed to the `VoronoiInterstitialGenerator`
                class (such as `clustering_tol`, `stol`, `min_dist` etc), or to
                `InterstitialGenerator` if `interstitial_coords` is specified.
            target_frac_coords (List):
                Defects are placed at the closest equivalent site to these fractional
                coordinates in the generated supercells. Default is [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
                if not set (i.e. the supercell centre, to aid visualisation).
            processes (int):
                Number of processes to use for multiprocessing. If not set, defaults to
                one less than the number of CPUs available.

        Attributes:
