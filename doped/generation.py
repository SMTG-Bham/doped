    r"""
    Get the doped/SnB defect name from a DefectEntry object.

    Note: If relaxed = True (default), then this tries to use the
    defect_entry.defect_supercell to determine the site symmetry. This will
    thus give the `relaxed` defect point symmetry if this is a DefectEntry
    created from parsed defect calculations. However, it should be noted
    that this is not guaranteed to work in all cases; namely for non-diagonal
    supercell expansions, or sometimes for non-scalar supercell expansion
    matrices (e.g. a 2x1x2 expansion)(particularly with high-symmetry materials)
    which can mess up the periodicity of the cell. doped tries to automatically
    check if this is the case, and will warn you if so.

    This can also be checked by using this function on your doped `generated` defects:

    .. code-block:: python

        from doped.generation import get_defect_name_from_entry
        for defect_name, defect_entry in defect_gen.items():
            print(defect_name, get_defect_name_from_entry(defect_entry, relaxed=False),
                  get_defect_name_from_entry(defect_entry), "\n")

    And if the point symmetries match in each case, then using this function on your
    parsed `relaxed` DefectEntry objects should correctly determine the final relaxed
    defect symmetry (and closest site info) - otherwise periodicity-breaking prevents this.

    Args:
        defect_entry (DefectEntry): ``DefectEntry`` object.
        element_list (list):
            Sorted list of elements in the host structure, so that
            closest_site_info returns deterministic results (in case two
            different elements located at the same distance from defect site).
            Default is None.
        symm_ops (list):
            List of symmetry operations of either the defect_entry.bulk_supercell
            structure (if relaxed=False) or defect_entry.defect_supercell (if
            relaxed=True), to avoid re-calculating. Default is None (recalculates).
        symprec (float):
            Symmetry tolerance for spglib. Default is 0.01 for unrelaxed structures,
            0.2 for relaxed (to account for residual structural noise). You may
            want to adjust for your system (e.g. if there are very slight
            octahedral distortions etc).
        relaxed (bool):
            If False, determines the site symmetry using the defect site `in the
            unrelaxed bulk supercell`, otherwise tries to determine the point
            symmetry of the relaxed defect in the defect supercell).

    Determine the ideal supercell matrix for a given structure, based on the
    minimum image distance, minimum number of atoms and ``ideal_threshold`` for
    further expanding if a diagonal expansion of the primitive/conventional
    cell is possible.

    The ideal supercell is the smallest possible supercell which has
    a minimum image distance (i.e. minimum distance between periodic
    images of atoms/sites in a lattice) greater than
    ``min_image_distance`` (default = 10 Å - which is a typical threshold
    value used in DFT defect supercell calculations) and a number of atoms
    greater than ``min_atoms`` (default = 50). Once these criteria have
    been reached, ``doped`` will then continue searching up to supercell
    sizes (numbers of atoms) ``1 + ideal_threshold`` times larger
    (rounded up) to see if they return a diagonal expansion of the
    primitive/conventional cell (which can make later visualisation and
    analysis much easier) - if so, this larger supercell will be returned.

    This search for the ideal supercell transformation matrix is performed using
    the ``find_ideal_supercell`` function from ``doped.utils.supercells`` (see
    its docstring for more details), which efficiently scans over possible
    supercell matrices and identifies that with the minimum image distance and
    most cubic-like supercell shape. The advantage of this over that in
    ``pymatgen-analysis-defects`` is that it avoids the ``find_optimal_cell_shape``
    function from ``ASE`` (which currently does not work for rotated matrices,
    is inefficient, and optimises based on cubic-like shape rather than minimum
    image distance), giving greatly reduced supercell sizes for a given minimum
    image distance.

    If ``force_cubic`` or ``force_diagonal`` are ``True``, then the
    ``CubicSupercellTransformation`` from ``pymatgen`` is used to identify any
    simple near-cubic supercell transformations which satisfy the minimum image
    distance and atom number criteria.

        Generates doped DefectEntry objects for defects in the input host
        structure. By default, generates all intrinsic defects, but extrinsic
        defects (impurities) can also be created using the ``extrinsic``
        argument.

        Interstitial sites are generated using Voronoi tessellation by default (found
        to be the most reliable), which can be controlled using the
        ``interstitial_gen_kwargs`` argument (passed as keyword arguments to the
        ``VoronoiInterstitialGenerator`` class). Alternatively, a list of interstitial
        sites (or single interstitial site) can be manually specified using the
        ``interstitial_coords`` argument.

        By default, supercells are generated for each defect using the doped
        ``get_ideal_supercell_matrix()`` function (see docstring), with default settings
        of ``min_image_distance = 10`` (minimum distance between periodic images of 10 Å),
        ``min_atoms = 50`` (minimum 50 atoms in the supercell) and ``ideal_threshold = 0.1``
        (allow up to 10% larger supercell if it is a diagonal expansion of the primitive
        or conventional cell). This uses a custom algorithm in ``doped`` to efficiently
        search over possible supercell transformations and identify that with the minimum
        number of atoms (hence computational cost) that satisfies the minimum image distance,
        number of atoms and ``ideal_threshold`` constraints. These settings can be controlled
        by specifying keyword arguments with ``supercell_gen_kwargs``, which are passed to
        ``get_ideal_supercell_matrix()`` (e.g. for a minimum image distance of 15 Å with at
        least 100 atoms, use:
        ``supercell_gen_kwargs = {'min_image_distance': 15, 'min_atoms': 100}``). If the
        input structure already satisfies these constraints (for the same number of atoms as
        the ``doped``-generated supercell), then it will be used.
        Alternatively if ``generate_supercell = False``, then no supercell is generated
        and the input structure is used as the defect & bulk supercell. (Note this
        may give a slightly different (but fully equivalent) set of coordinates).

        The algorithm for determining defect entry names is to use the pymatgen defect
        name (e.g. ``v_Cd``, ``Cd_Te`` etc.) for vacancies/antisites/substitutions, unless
        there are multiple inequivalent sites for the defect, in which case the point
        group of the defect site is appended (e.g. ``v_Cd_Td``, ``Cd_Te_Td`` etc.), and if
        this is still not unique, then element identity and distance to the nearest
        neighbour of the defect site is appended (e.g. ``v_Cd_Td_Te2.83``, ``Cd_Te_Td_Cd2.83``
        etc.). For interstitials, the same naming scheme is used, but the point group
        is always appended to the pymatgen defect name.

        Possible charge states for the defects are estimated using the probability of
        the corresponding defect element oxidation state, the magnitude of the charge
        state, and the maximum magnitude of the host oxidation states (i.e. how
        'charged' the host is), with large (absolute) charge states, low probability
        oxidation states and/or greater charge/oxidation state magnitudes than that of
        the host being disfavoured. This can be controlled using the
        ``probability_threshold`` (default = 0.0075) or ``padding`` (default = 1) keys in
        the ``charge_state_gen_kwargs`` parameter, which are passed to the
        ``_charge_state_probability()`` function. The input and computed values used to
        guess charge state probabilities are provided in the
        ``DefectEntry.charge_state_guessing_log`` attributes. See docs for examples of
        modifying the generated charge states.

        Args:
            structure (Structure):
                Structure of the host material (as a pymatgen Structure object).
                If this is not the primitive unit cell, it will be reduced to the
                primitive cell for defect generation, before supercell generation.
            extrinsic (Union[str, list, dict]):
                List or dict of elements (or string for single element) to be used
                for extrinsic defect generation (i.e. dopants/impurities). If a
                list is provided, all possible substitutional defects for each
                extrinsic element will be generated. If a dict is provided, the keys
                should be the host elements to be substituted, and the values the
                extrinsic element(s) to substitute in; as a string or list.
                In both cases, all possible extrinsic interstitials are generated.
            interstitial_coords (list):
                List of fractional coordinates (corresponding to the input structure),
                or a single set of fractional coordinates, to use as interstitial
                defect site(s). Default (when interstitial_coords not specified) is
                to automatically generate interstitial sites using Voronoi tessellation.
                The input interstitial_coords are converted to
                DefectsGenerator.prim_interstitial_coords, which are the corresponding
                fractional coordinates in DefectsGenerator.primitive_structure (which
                is used for defect generation), along with the multiplicity and
                equivalent coordinates, sorted according to the doped convention.
            generate_supercell (bool):
                Whether to generate a supercell for the output defect entries
                (using the custom algorithm in ``doped`` which efficiently searches over
                possible supercell transformations and identifies that with the minimum
                number of atoms (hence computational cost) that satisfies the minimum
                image distance, number of atoms and ``ideal_threshold`` constraints
                - which can be controlled with ``supercell_gen_kwargs``).
                If False, then the input structure is used as the defect & bulk supercell.
                (Note this may give a slightly different (but fully equivalent) set of coordinates).
            charge_state_gen_kwargs (dict):
                Keyword arguments to be passed to the ``_charge_state_probability``
                function (such as ``probability_threshold`` (default = 0.0075, used for
                substitutions and interstitials) and ``padding`` (default = 1, used for
                vacancies)) to control defect charge state generation.
            supercell_gen_kwargs (dict):
                Keyword arguments to be passed to the ``get_ideal_supercell_matrix``
                function (such as ``min_image_distance`` (default = 10), ``min_atoms``
                (default = 50), ``ideal_threshold`` (default = 0.1), ``force_cubic``
                - which enforces a (near-)cubic supercell output (default = False),
                or ``force_diagonal`` (default = False)).
            interstitial_gen_kwargs (dict, bool):
                Keyword arguments to be passed to the ``VoronoiInterstitialGenerator``
                class (such as ``clustering_tol``, ``stol``, ``min_dist`` etc), or to
                ``InterstitialGenerator`` if ``interstitial_coords`` is specified.
                If set to False, interstitial generation will be skipped entirely.
            target_frac_coords (list):
                Defects are placed at the closest equivalent site to these fractional
                coordinates in the generated supercells. Default is [0.5, 0.5, 0.5]
                if not set (i.e. the supercell centre, to aid visualisation).
            processes (int):
                Number of processes to use for multiprocessing. If not set, defaults to
                one less than the number of CPUs available.

        Attributes:
            defect_entries (dict): Dictionary of {defect_species: DefectEntry} for all
                defect entries (with charge state and supercell properties) generated.
