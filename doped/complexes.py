    """
    Classify the geometry of a given vacancy in a supercell, as either a
    'simple' point vacancy, a 'split' vacancy, or a 'non-trivial' vacancy.

    Split vacancy geometries are those where 2 vacancies and 1 interstitial
    are found to be present in the defect structure, as determined using
    site-matching between the defect and bulk structures with a fractional
    distance tolerance (``tol``), such that the absence of any site of
    matching species within the distance tolerance to the original bulk site
    is considered a vacancy, and vice versa in comparing the bulk to the defect
    structure is an interstitial. This corresponds to the 2 V_X + X_i
    definition of split vacancies discussed in
    https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2412.19330

    A simple vacancy corresponds to cases where 1 site from the bulk structure
    cannot be matched to the defect structure while all defect structure sites
    can be matched to bulk sites, and 'non-trivial' vacancies refer to all
    other cases.

    Inspired by the vacancy geometry classification used in Kumagai et al.

    further details.

    Generate all equivalent complex defect site configurations in the primitive
    unit cell, for the input constituent point defect sites of the complex.

    The input sites should correspond to the input bulk supercell.

    The approach followed in this function is:

    1. Generate all symmetry-equivalent sites in the primitive unit cell, for
    the input constituent point defect sites of the complex.

    2. Choose one constituent point defect as the 'anchor' site, based on
    estimated computational efficiency.

    3. Generate a 'template' complex defect molecule, using the ``pymatgen``
    ``Molecule`` class.

    4. From the sets of symmetry-equivalent defect sites in the primitive unit
    cell, generate all possible combinations of candidate point defect sites
    that have inter-defect distances matching the input complex defect sites
    (+/- 2 :math:`\times` ``dist_tol``).

    5. From these candidate site combinations, generate complex defect
    molecules (as ``pymatgen`` ``Molecule``\s), and reduce to only those which
    are symmetry-equivalent to the input complex defect, and are distinct (i.e.
    not identical or periodic images; to avoid potential double counting).

    Args:
        bulk_supercell (Structure):
            The bulk supercell structure to which the input sites correspond.
        vacancy_sites (Iterable[PeriodicSite] | PeriodicSite | None):
            The site(s) of vacancies in the defect complex. Default is
            ``None``.
        interstitial_sites (Iterable[PeriodicSite] | PeriodicSite | None):
            The site(s) of interstitials in the defect complex. Default is
            ``None``.
        substitution_sites (Iterable[PeriodicSite] | PeriodicSite | None):
            The site(s) of substitutions in the defect complex. Default is
            ``None``.
        primitive_structure (Structure | None):
            The primitive unit cell structure, in which to get equivalent
            complex defect sites. If ``None`` (default), the primitive
            structure will be determined from the bulk supercell.
        supercell_symm_ops (list[SymmOp] | None):
            The symmetry operations of the bulk supercell, which can be
            provided to speed up the search for equivalent sites. If ``None``
            (default), these are automatically determined.
        dist_tol (float):
            Distance tolerance for clustering generated equivalent sites (to
            ensure they are truly distinct), searching for equivalent sites
            (by inter-defect distances) and matching equivalent complex defect
            geometries (as ``Molecule``\s), in Å. Default is 0.01 Å.
            Note that this should match the value used for determining the
            point defect multiplicities (e.g. with the
            ``Defect.get_multiplicity()`` methods) for appropriate comparisons
            -- the same default of 0.01 Å is used in all relevant ``doped``
            functions.
        symprec (float):
            Symmetry precision for determining the primitive structure (if not
            provided), supercell symmetry operations (if not provided) and
            equivalent defect sites in the primitive unit cell. Defaults to
            0.01. Note that this should match the value used for determining
            the point defect multiplicities (e.g. with the
            ``Defect.get_multiplicity()`` methods) for appropriate comparisons
            -- the same default of 0.01 is used in all relevant ``doped``
            functions.
        return_molecules (bool):
            Whether to return the equivalent complex defect molecules as
            ``Molecule`` objects, or as lists of ``PeriodicSite``
            objects. Default is ``False`` (return lists of ``PeriodicSite``\s).

    Returns:
        list[list[PeriodicSite]] | list[Molecule]:
            List of equivalent complex defect sites as ``Molecule``\s
            or lists of ``PeriodicSite``\s, depending on the value of
            ``return_molecules``.

    r"""
    Get the multiplicity of a given complex defect configuration (as given by
    the combination of input constituent point defect sites).

    The complex defect multiplicity is given by the number of distinct
    symmetry-equivalent complex defect site configurations in the unit cell.
    The returned multiplicity value corresponds to the `primitive cell` site
    multiplicity by default (``primitive_cell_multiplicity = True``).

    The input sites should correspond to the input bulk supercell.

    The multiplicity is calculated by generating all possible
    symmetry-equivalent complex defect site configurations in the primitive
    unit cell; see ``get_equivalent_complex_defect_sites_in_primitive()`` for
    details.

    Args:
        bulk_supercell (Structure):
            The bulk supercell structure to which the input sites correspond.
        vacancy_sites (Iterable[PeriodicSite] | PeriodicSite | None):
            The site(s) of vacancies in the defect complex. Default is
            ``None``.
        interstitial_sites (Iterable[PeriodicSite] | PeriodicSite | None):
            The site(s) of interstitials in the defect complex. Default is
            ``None``.
        substitution_sites (Iterable[PeriodicSite] | PeriodicSite | None):
            The site(s) of substitutions in the defect complex. Default is
            ``None``.
        primitive_structure (Structure | None):
            The primitive unit cell structure, in which to get equivalent
            complex defect sites. If ``None`` (default), the primitive
            structure will be determined from the bulk supercell.
        supercell_symm_ops (list[SymmOp] | None):
            The symmetry operations of the bulk supercell, which can be
            provided to speed up the search for equivalent sites. If ``None``
            (default), these are automatically determined.
        dist_tol (float):
            Distance tolerance for clustering generated equivalent sites (to
            ensure they are truly distinct), searching for equivalent sites
            (by inter-defect distances) and matching equivalent complex defect
            geometries (as ``Molecule``\s), in Å. Default is 0.01 Å.
            Note that this should match the value used for determining the
            point defect multiplicities (e.g. with the
            ``Defect.get_multiplicity()`` methods) for appropriate comparisons
            -- the same default of 0.01 Å is used in all relevant ``doped``
            functions.
        symprec (float):
            Symmetry precision for determining the primitive structure (if not
            provided), supercell symmetry operations (if not provided) and
            equivalent defect sites in the primitive unit cell. Defaults to
            0.01. Note that this should match the value used for determining
            the point defect multiplicities (e.g. with the
            ``Defect.get_multiplicity()`` methods) for appropriate comparisons
            -- the same default of 0.01 is used in all relevant ``doped``
            functions.
        primitive_cell_multiplicity (bool):
            Whether to return the site multiplicity in the primitive unit cell
            (``True``) or the bulk supercell (``False``). Default is ``True``.

    Returns:
        int:
            The multiplicity of the input complex defect configuration, in the
            primitive unit cell if ``primitive_cell_multiplicity = True``
            (default), or in the bulk supercell if
            ``primitive_cell_multiplicity = False``.
