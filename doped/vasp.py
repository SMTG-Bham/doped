        The supercell structure and charge state are taken from the
        ``DefectEntry`` attributes, or if a ``Structure`` is provided, then
        from the ``defect_supercell`` and ``charge_state`` input parameters.

        Creates attributes:

        - ``DefectRelaxSet.vasp_gam``:
            ``DefectDictSet`` for Gamma-point only relaxation. Usually not needed if
            ShakeNBreak structure searching has been performed (recommended), unless
            only Γ-point `k`-point sampling is required (converged) for your system,
            and no vasp_std calculations with multiple `k`-points are required
            (determined from kpoints settings).
        - ``DefectRelaxSet.vasp_nkred_std``:
            ``DefectDictSet`` for relaxation with a kpoint mesh and using ``NKRED``. Not
            generated for GGA calculations (if ``LHFCALC`` is set to ``False`` in
            user_incar_settings) or if only Gamma `k`-point sampling is required.
        - ``DefectRelaxSet.vasp_std``:
            ``DefectDictSet`` for relaxation with a kpoint
            mesh, not using ``NKRED``. Not generated if only Gamma kpoint sampling is
            required.
        - ``DefectRelaxSet.vasp_ncl``:
            ``DefectDictSet`` for singlepoint (static) energy calculation with SOC
            included. Generated if ``soc=True``. If ``soc`` is not set, then by default
            is only generated for systems with a max atomic number (Z) >= 31 (i.e.
            further down the periodic table than Zn).

        where ``DefectDictSet`` is an extension of ``pymatgen``'s ``DictSet`` class for
        defect calculations, with ``incar``, ``poscar``, ``kpoints`` and ``potcar``
        attributes for the corresponding VASP defect calculations (see docstring).
        Also creates the corresponding ``bulk_vasp_...`` attributes for singlepoint
        (static) energy calculations of the bulk (pristine, defect-free)
        supercell. This needs to be calculated once with the same settings as the
        defect calculations, for the later calculation of defect formation energies.

        See the ``RelaxSet.yaml`` and ``DefectSet.yaml`` files in the
        ``doped/VASP_sets`` folder for the default ``INCAR`` and ``KPOINT`` settings,
        and ``PotcarSet.yaml`` for the default ``POTCAR`` settings.
        **These are reasonable defaults that _roughly_ match the typical values
        needed for accurate defect calculations, but usually will need to be
        modified for your specific system, such as converged ENCUT and KPOINTS,
        and NCORE / KPAR matching your HPC setup.**

        Note that any changes to the default ``INCAR``/``POTCAR`` settings should
        be consistent with those used for all defect and competing phase
        (chemical potential) calculations.

        Args:
            defect_entry (DefectEntry, Structure):
                doped/pymatgen DefectEntry or Structure (defect supercell) for
                which to generate ``DefectDictSet``\s for.
            charge_state (int):
                Charge state of the defect. Overrides ``DefectEntry.charge_state`` if
                ``DefectEntry`` is input.
            soc (bool):
                Whether to generate ``vasp_ncl`` DefectDictSet attribute for spin-orbit
                coupling singlepoint (static) energy calculations. If not set, then
                by default is set to True if the max atomic number (Z) in the
                structure is >= 31 (i.e. further down the periodic table than Zn),
                otherwise False.
            user_incar_settings (dict):
                Dictionary of user INCAR settings (AEXX, NCORE etc.) to override
                default settings. Highly recommended to look at output INCARs
                or the ``RelaxSet.yaml`` and ``DefectSet.yaml`` files in the
                ``doped/VASP_sets`` folder, to see what the default INCAR settings are.
                Note that any flags that aren't numbers or True/False need to be input
                as strings with quotation marks (e.g. ``{"ALGO": "All"}``).
                (default: None)
            user_kpoints_settings (dict or Kpoints):
                Dictionary of user KPOINTS settings (in pymatgen DictSet() format)
                e.g. {"reciprocal_density": 123}, or a Kpoints object, to use for the
                ``vasp_std``, ``vasp_nkred_std`` and ``vasp_ncl`` DefectDictSets (Γ-only for
                ``vasp_gam``). Default is Gamma-centred, reciprocal_density = 100 [Å⁻³].
            user_potcar_functional (str):
                POTCAR functional to use. Default is "PBE" and if this fails,
                tries "PBE_52", then "PBE_54".
            user_potcar_settings (dict):
                Override the default POTCARs, e.g. {"Li": "Li_sv"}. See
                ``doped/VASP_sets/PotcarSet.yaml`` for the default ``POTCAR`` set.
            **kwargs: Additional kwargs to pass to ``DefectDictSet()``.

        Attributes:
            vasp_gam (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for Gamma-point only relaxation. Usually not needed
                if ShakeNBreak structure searching has been performed
                (recommended), unless only Γ-point `k`-point sampling is required
                (converged) for your system, and no vasp_std calculations with
                multiple `k`-points are required (determined from kpoints settings).
            vasp_nkred_std (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for relaxation with a non-Γ-only kpoint mesh, using
                ``NKRED(X,Y,Z)`` INCAR tag(s) to downsample kpoints for the HF exchange
                part of the hybrid DFT calculation. Not generated for GGA calculations
                (if ``LHFCALC`` is set to ``False`` in user_incar_settings) or if only Gamma
                kpoint sampling is required.
            vasp_std (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for relaxation with a non-Γ-only kpoint mesh, not using
                ``NKRED``. Not generated if only Gamma kpoint sampling is required.
            vasp_ncl (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for singlepoint (static) energy calculation with SOC
                included. Generated if ``soc=True``. If ``soc`` is not set, then by default
                is only generated for systems with a max atomic number (Z) >= 31
                (i.e. further down the periodic table than Zn).
            defect_supercell (Structure):
                Supercell structure for defect calculations, taken from
                defect_entry.defect_supercell (if defined), otherwise from
                defect_entry.sc_entry.structure if inputting a DefectEntry object,
                or the input structure if inputting a Structure object.
            bulk_supercell (Structure):
                Supercell structure of the bulk (pristine, defect-free) material,
                taken from defect_entry.bulk_supercell (if defined), otherwise from
                defect_entry.bulk_entry.structure if inputting a DefectEntry object,
                or None if inputting a Structure object.
            poscar_comment (str):
                Comment to write at the top of the POSCAR files. Default is the
                defect entry name, defect frac coords and charge state (if
                inputting a DefectEntry object), or the formula of the input
                structure and charge state (if inputting a Structure object),
                for defects. For the bulk supercell, it's "{formula} - Bulk".
            bulk_vasp_gam (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for a `bulk` Γ-point-only singlepoint (static)
                supercell calculation. Often not used, as the bulk supercell only
                needs to be calculated once with the same settings as the final
                defect calculations, which may be with ``vasp_std`` or ``vasp_ncl``.
            bulk_vasp_nkred_std (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for a singlepoint (static) `bulk` ``vasp_std`` supercell

                INCAR tag(s) to downsample kpoints for the HF exchange part of the
                hybrid DFT calculation. Not generated for GGA calculations (if
                ``LHFCALC`` is set to ``False`` in user_incar_settings) or if only Gamma
                kpoint sampling is required.
            bulk_vasp_std (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for a singlepoint (static) `bulk` ``vasp_std`` supercell
                calculation with a non-Γ-only kpoint mesh, not using ``NKRED``. Not
                generated if only Gamma kpoint sampling is required.
            bulk_vasp_ncl (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for singlepoint (static) energy calculation of the `bulk`
                supercell with SOC included. Generated if ``soc=True``. If ``soc`` is not
                set, then by default is only generated for systems with a max atomic
                number (Z) >= 31 (i.e. further down the periodic table than Zn).

        and ``PotcarSet.yaml`` for the default ``POTCAR`` settings. **These are
        reasonable defaults that _roughly_ match the typical values needed for
        accurate defect calculations, but usually will need to be modified for
        your specific system, such as converged ENCUT and KPOINTS, and NCORE /
        KPAR matching your HPC setup.**

        Note that any changes to the default ``INCAR``/``POTCAR`` settings should
        be consistent with those used for all defect and competing phase (
        chemical potential) calculations.

        The ``DefectEntry`` object is also written to a ``json`` file in
        ``defect_dir`` to aid calculation provenance.

        Args:
            defect_dir (str):
                Folder in which to create the VASP defect calculation inputs.
                Default is to use the DefectEntry name (e.g. "Y_i_C4v_O1.92_+2"
                etc.), from ``self.defect_entry.name``. If this attribute is not
                set, it is automatically generated according to the doped
                convention (using ``get_defect_name_from_entry()``).
            subfolder (str):
                Output folder structure is ``<defect_dir>/<subfolder>`` where
                ``subfolder`` = 'vasp_ncl' by default. Setting ``subfolder`` to
                ``None`` will write the ``vasp_ncl`` input files directly to the
                ``<defect_dir>`` folder, with no subfolders created.
            unperturbed_poscar (bool):
                If True, write the unperturbed defect POSCAR to the generated
                folder as well. Not recommended, as the recommended workflow is
                to initially perform ``vasp_gam`` ground-state structure searching
                using ShakeNBreak (https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io), then continue
                the ``vasp(_nkred)_std`` relaxations from the ground-state structures
                (e.g. using ``-d vasp_nkred_std`` with `snb-groundstate` (CLI) or

                ``write_groundstate_structure`` (Python API)), first with NKRED if

        Write all VASP input files to subfolders in the ``defect_dir`` folder.

        The following subfolders are generated:

        - ``vasp_nkred_std``:
            Defect relaxation with a kpoint mesh and using ``NKRED``. Not
            generated for GGA calculations (if ``LHFCALC`` is set to ``False``
            in ``user_incar_settings``) or if only Γ-point sampling required.
        - ``vasp_std``:
            Defect relaxation with a kpoint mesh, not using ``NKRED``. Not
            generated if only Γ-point sampling required.
        - ``vasp_ncl``:
            Singlepoint (static) energy calculation with SOC included.
            Generated if ``soc=True``. If ``soc`` is not set, then by default is
            only generated for systems with a max atomic number (Z) >= 31
            (i.e. further down the periodic table than Zn).

        If vasp_gam=True (not recommended) or self.vasp_std = None (i.e. Γ-only
        `k`-point sampling converged for the kpoints settings used), then also
        outputs:

        - ``vasp_gam``:
            Γ-point only defect relaxation. Usually not needed if ShakeNBreak
            structure searching has been performed (recommended).

        By default, does not generate a ``vasp_gam`` folder unless ``self.vasp_std``
        is None (i.e. only Γ-point sampling required for this system), as
        ``vasp_gam`` calculations should be performed using ``ShakeNBreak`` for
        defect structure-searching and initial relaxations. If ``vasp_gam`` files
        are desired, set ``vasp_gam=True``.

        By default, ``POSCAR`` files are not generated for the ``vasp_(nkred_)std``
        (and ``vasp_ncl`` if ``self.soc`` is True) folders, as these should
        be taken from ``ShakeNBreak`` calculations (via
        ``snb-groundstate -d vasp_nkred_std``) or, if not following the recommended
        structure-searching workflow, from the ``CONTCAR``\s of ``vasp_gam``
        calculations. If including SOC effects (``self.soc = True``), then the
        ``vasp_std`` ``CONTCAR``\s should be used as the ``vasp_ncl`` ``POSCAR``\s.
        If unperturbed ``POSCAR`` files are desired for the ``vasp_(nkred_)std``
        (and ``vasp_ncl``) folders, set ``unperturbed_poscar=True``.

        Input files for the singlepoint (static) bulk supercell reference
        calculation are also written to "{formula}_bulk/{subfolder}" if ``bulk``
        is True (False by default), where ``subfolder`` corresponds to the final
        (highest accuracy) VASP calculation in the workflow (i.e. ``vasp_ncl`` if
        ``self.soc=True``, otherwise ``vasp_std`` or ``vasp_gam`` if only Γ-point
        reciprocal space sampling is required). If ``bulk = "all"``, then the
        input files for all VASP calculations in the workflow are written to
        the bulk supercell folder.

        See the ``RelaxSet.yaml`` and ``DefectSet.yaml`` files in the
        ``doped/VASP_sets`` folder for the default ``INCAR`` and ``KPOINT`` settings,
        and ``PotcarSet.yaml`` for the default ``POTCAR`` settings. **These are
        reasonable defaults that _roughly_ match the typical values needed for

        Creates a dictionary of: {defect_species: DefectRelaxSet}.

        DefectRelaxSet has the attributes:

        - ``DefectRelaxSet.vasp_gam``:
            ``DefectDictSet`` for Gamma-point only relaxation. Usually not needed if
            ShakeNBreak structure searching has been performed (recommended), unless
            only Γ-point `k`-point sampling is required (converged) for your system,
            and no vasp_std calculations with multiple `k`-points are required
            (determined from kpoints settings).
        - ``DefectRelaxSet.vasp_nkred_std``:
            ``DefectDictSet`` for relaxation with a kpoint mesh and using ``NKRED``.
            Not generated for GGA calculations (if ``LHFCALC`` is set to ``False`` in
            ``user_incar_settings``) or if only Gamma kpoint sampling is required.
        - ``DefectRelaxSet.vasp_std``:
            ``DefectDictSet`` for relaxation with a kpoint mesh, not using ``NKRED``.
            Not generated if only Gamma kpoint sampling is required.
        - ``DefectRelaxSet.vasp_ncl``:
            ``DefectDictSet`` for singlepoint (static) energy calculation with SOC
            included. Generated if ``soc=True``. If ``soc`` is not set, then by default
            is only generated for systems with a max atomic number (Z) >= 31
            (i.e. further down the periodic table than Zn).

        where ``DefectDictSet`` is an extension of ``pymatgen``'s ``DictSet`` class for
        defect calculations, with ``incar``, ``poscar``, ``kpoints`` and ``potcar``
        attributes for the corresponding VASP defect calculations (see docstring).
        Also creates the corresponding ``bulk_vasp_...`` attributes for singlepoint
        (static) energy calculations of the bulk (pristine, defect-free) supercell.
        This needs to be calculated once with the same settings as the final defect
        calculations, for the later calculation of defect formation energies.

        See the ``RelaxSet.yaml`` and ``DefectSet.yaml`` files in the
        ``doped/VASP_sets`` folder for the default ``INCAR`` settings, and
        ``PotcarSet.yaml`` for the default ``POTCAR`` settings.

        Note that any changes to the default ``INCAR``/``POTCAR`` settings should
        be consistent with those used for all defect and competing phase (chemical
        potential) calculations.

                ``DefectEntry``\s, or a single ``DefectEntry`` object, for which
                to generate VASP input files.
                If a ``DefectsGenerator`` object or a dictionary (->
                {defect_species: DefectEntry}), the defect folder names will be
                set equal to ``defect_species``. If a list or single ``DefectEntry``

                ``DefectEntry.name`` if the ``name`` attribute is set, otherwise

            user_incar_settings (dict):
                Dictionary of user INCAR settings (AEXX, NCORE etc.) to override
                default settings. Highly recommended to look at output INCARs or the
                ``RelaxSet.yaml`` and ``DefectSet.yaml`` files in the ``doped/VASP_sets``
                folder, to see what the default INCAR settings are. Note that any
                flags that aren't numbers or True/False need to be input as strings
                with quotation marks (e.g. ``{"ALGO": "All"}``).
                (default: None)
            user_kpoints_settings (dict or Kpoints):
                Dictionary of user KPOINTS settings (in pymatgen DictSet() format)
                e.g. {"reciprocal_density": 123}, or a Kpoints object, to use for the
                ``vasp_std``, ``vasp_nkred_std`` and ``vasp_ncl`` DefectDictSets (Γ-only for
                ``vasp_gam``). Default is Gamma-centred, reciprocal_density = 100 [Å⁻³].
            user_potcar_functional (str):
                POTCAR functional to use. Default is "PBE" and if this fails, tries
                "PBE_52", then "PBE_54".
            user_potcar_settings (dict):
                Override the default POTCARs, e.g. {"Li": "Li_sv"}. See
                ``doped/VASP_setsPotcarSet.yaml`` for the default ``POTCAR`` set.
            **kwargs: Additional kwargs to pass to each ``DefectRelaxSet()``.

        Attributes:
            defect_sets (Dict):
                Dictionary of {defect_species: ``DefectRelaxSet``}.
            defect_entries (Dict):
                Dictionary of {defect_species: DefectEntry} for the input defect
                species, for which to generate VASP input files.
            bulk_vasp_gam (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for a `bulk` Γ-point-only singlepoint (static)
                supercell calculation. Often not used, as the bulk supercell only
                needs to be calculated once with the same settings as the final
                defect calculations, which may be with ``vasp_std`` or ``vasp_ncl``.
            bulk_vasp_nkred_std (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for a singlepoint (static) `bulk` ``vasp_std`` supercell
                calculation (i.e. with a non-Γ-only kpoint mesh) and ``NKRED(X,Y,Z)``
                INCAR tag(s) to downsample kpoints for the HF exchange part of the
                hybrid DFT calculation. Not generated for GGA calculations (if
                ``LHFCALC`` is set to ``False`` in user_incar_settings) or if only Gamma
                kpoint sampling is required.
            bulk_vasp_std (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for a singlepoint (static) `bulk` ``vasp_std`` supercell
                calculation with a non-Γ-only kpoint mesh, not using ``NKRED``. Not
                generated if only Gamma kpoint sampling is required.
            bulk_vasp_ncl (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for singlepoint (static) energy calculation of the `bulk`
                supercell with SOC included. Generated if ``soc=True``. If ``soc`` is not
                set, then by default is only generated for systems with a max atomic
                number (Z) >= 31 (i.e. further down the periodic table than Zn).
            json_obj (Union[Dict, DefectsGenerator]):

        Write VASP input files to folders for all defects in
        ``self.defect_entries``. Folder names are set to the key of the
        DefectRelaxSet in ``self.defect_sets`` (same as self.defect_entries
        keys, see ``DefectsSet`` docstring).

        For each defect folder, the following subfolders are generated:

        - ``vasp_nkred_std``:
            Defect relaxation with a kpoint mesh and using ``NKRED``. Not generated
            for GGA calculations (if ``LHFCALC`` is set to ``False`` in
            ``user_incar_settings``) or if only Γ-point sampling required.
        - ``vasp_std``:
            Defect relaxation with a kpoint mesh, not using ``NKRED``. Not
            generated if only Γ-point sampling required.
        - ``vasp_ncl``:
            Singlepoint (static) energy calculation with SOC included. Generated if
            ``soc=True``. If ``soc`` is not set, then by default is only generated
            for systems with a max atomic number (Z) >= 31 (i.e. further down the
            periodic table than Zn).

        If ``vasp_gam=True`` (not recommended) or ``self.vasp_std = None`` (i.e. Γ-only
        `k`-point sampling converged for the kpoints settings used), then also
        outputs:

        - ``vasp_gam``:
            Γ-point only defect relaxation. Usually not needed if ShakeNBreak structure
            searching has been performed (recommended).

        By default, does not generate a ``vasp_gam`` folder unless
        ``DefectRelaxSet.vasp_std`` is None (i.e. only Γ-point sampling required
        for this system), as ``vasp_gam`` calculations should be performed using
        ``ShakeNBreak`` for defect structure-searching and initial relaxations.
        If ``vasp_gam`` files are desired, set ``vasp_gam=True``.

        By default, ``POSCAR`` files are not generated for the ``vasp_(nkred_)std``
        (and ``vasp_ncl`` if ``self.soc`` is True) folders, as these should
        be taken from ``vasp_gam`` ``ShakeNBreak`` calculations (via
        ``snb-groundstate -d vasp_nkred_std``), some other structure-searching
        approach or, if not following the recommended structure-searching workflow,
        from the ``CONTCAR``\s of ``vasp_gam`` calculations. If including SOC
        effects (``self.soc = True``), then the ``vasp_std`` ``CONTCAR``\s
        should be used as the ``vasp_ncl`` ``POSCAR``\s. If unperturbed
        ``POSCAR`` files are desired for the ``vasp_(nkred_)std`` (and ``vasp_ncl``)
        folders, set ``unperturbed_poscar=True``.

        Input files for the singlepoint (static) bulk supercell reference
        calculation are also written to "{formula}_bulk/{subfolder}" if ``bulk``
        is ``True`` (default), where ``subfolder`` corresponds to the final (highest
        accuracy) VASP calculation in the workflow (i.e. ``vasp_ncl`` if
        ``self.soc=True``, otherwise ``vasp_std`` or ``vasp_gam`` if only Γ-point
        reciprocal space sampling is required). If ``bulk = "all"``, then the
        input files for all VASP calculations (gam/std/ncl) are written to the bulk
        supercell folder, or if ``bulk = False``, then no bulk folder is created.

        The ``DefectEntry`` objects are also written to ``json`` files in the defect
        folders, as well as ``self.defect_entries`` (``self.json_obj``) in the top
        folder, to aid calculation provenance.

        See the ``RelaxSet.yaml`` and ``DefectSet.yaml`` files in the
        ``doped/VASP_sets`` folder for the default ``INCAR`` and ``KPOINT`` settings,
        and ``PotcarSet.yaml`` for the default ``POTCAR`` settings. **These are
        reasonable defaults that _roughly_ match the typical values needed for
        accurate defect calculations, but usually will need to be modified for
        your specific system, such as converged ENCUT and KPOINTS, and NCORE /
        KPAR matching your HPC setup.**

        Note that any changes to the default ``INCAR``/``POTCAR`` settings should
        be consistent with those used for all defect and competing phase (
        chemical potential) calculations.

            output_path (str):
                Folder in which to create the VASP defect calculation folders.
                Default is the current directory ("."). Output folder structure
                is ``<output_path>/<defect_species>/<subfolder>`` where
                ``defect_species`` is the key of the DefectRelaxSet in
                ``self.defect_sets`` (same as ``self.defect_entries`` keys, see
                ``DefectsSet`` docstring) and ``subfolder`` is the name of the
                corresponding VASP program to run (e.g. ``vasp_std``).

                If True, write the unperturbed defect POSCARs to the generated
                folders as well. Not recommended, as the recommended workflow is
                to initially perform ``vasp_gam`` ground-state structure searching
                using ShakeNBreak (https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io), then continue
                the ``vasp(_nkred)_std`` relaxations from the ground-state structures
                (e.g. using ``-d vasp_nkred_std`` with `snb-groundstate` (CLI) or
                ``groundstate_folder="vasp_nkred_std"`` with
                ``write_groundstate_structure`` (Python API)) first with NKRED if
                using hybrid DFT, then without, then use the ``vasp_std`` ``CONTCAR``\s
                as the input structures for the final ``vasp_ncl`` singlepoint
                calculations.

                perform ``vasp_gam`` ground-state structure searching using ShakeNBreak
                (https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io), then continue the ``vasp_std``
                relaxations from the SnB ground-state structures.

            bulk (bool, str):
                If True, the input files for a singlepoint calculation of the
                bulk supercell are also written to "{formula}_bulk/{subfolder}",
                where ``subfolder`` corresponds to the final (highest accuracy)
                VASP calculation in the workflow (i.e. ``vasp_ncl`` if ``self.soc=True``,
                otherwise ``vasp_std`` or ``vasp_gam`` if only Γ-point reciprocal space
