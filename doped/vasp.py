            user_kpoints_settings (dict or Kpoints):
                Dictionary of user KPOINTS settings (in pymatgen DictSet() format)
                e.g. {"reciprocal_density": 123}, or a Kpoints object, to use for the

                `vasp_gam`). Default is Gamma-centred, reciprocal_density = 100 [Å⁻³].
            user_potcar_functional (str):
                POTCAR functional to use. Default is "PBE" and if this fails,
                tries "PBE_52", then "PBE_54".
            user_potcar_settings (dict):
                Override the default POTCARs, e.g. {"Li": "Li_sv"}. See
                `doped/VASP_sets/PotcarSet.yaml` for the default `POTCAR` set.
            **kwargs: Additional kwargs to pass to DictSet().

        Attributes:
            vasp_gam (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for Gamma-point only relaxation. Not needed if
                ShakeNBreak structure searching has been performed (recommended),
                unless only Γ-point _k_-point sampling is required (converged)
                for your system, and no vasp_std calculations with multiple
                _k_-points are required (determined from kpoints settings).
            vasp_nkred_std (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for relaxation with a non-Γ-only kpoint mesh, using
                `NKRED(X,Y,Z)` INCAR tag(s) to downsample kpoints for the HF exchange
                part of the hybrid DFT calculation`. Not generated for GGA calculations
                (if `LHFCALC` is set to `False` in user_incar_settings) or if only Gamma
                kpoint sampling is required.
            vasp_std (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for relaxation with a non-Γ-only kpoint mesh, not using
                `NKRED`. Not generated if only Gamma kpoint sampling is required.
            vasp_ncl (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for singlepoint (static) energy calculation with SOC
                included. Generated if `soc=True`. If `soc` is not set, then by default
                is only generated for systems with a max atomic number (Z) >= 31
                (i.e. further down the periodic table than Zn).
            defect_supercell (Structure):
                Supercell structure for defect calculations, taken from
                defect_entry.defect_supercell (if defined), otherwise from
                defect_entry.sc_entry.structure if inputting a DefectEntry object,
                or the input structure if inputting a Structure object.
            bulk_supercell (Structure):
                Supercell structure of the bulk (pristine, defect-free) material,
                taken from defect_entry.bulk_supercell (if defined), otherwise from
                defect_entry.bulk_entry.structure if inputting a DefectEntry object,
                or None if inputting a Structure object.
            poscar_comment (str):
                Comment to write at the top of the POSCAR files. Default is the
                defect entry name, defect frac coords and charge state (if
                inputting a DefectEntry object), or the formula of the input
                structure and charge state (if inputting a Structure object),
                for defects. For the bulk supercell, it's "{formula} - Bulk".
            bulk_vasp_gam (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for a _bulk_ Γ-point-only singlepoint (static)
                supercell calculation. Often not used, as the bulk supercell only
                needs to be calculated once with the same settings as the final
                defect calculations, which may be with `vasp_std` or `vasp_ncl`.
            bulk_vasp_nkred_std (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for a singlepoint (static) _bulk_ `vasp_std` supercell
                calculation (i.e. with a non-Γ-only kpoint mesh) and `NKRED(X,Y,Z)`
                INCAR tag(s) to downsample kpoints for the HF exchange part of the
                hybrid DFT calculation. Not generated for GGA calculations (if
                `LHFCALC` is set to `False` in user_incar_settings) or if only Gamma
                kpoint sampling is required.
            bulk_vasp_std (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for a singlepoint (static) _bulk_ `vasp_std` supercell
                calculation with a non-Γ-only kpoint mesh, not using `NKRED`. Not
                generated if only Gamma kpoint sampling is required.
            bulk_vasp_ncl (DefectDictSet):
                DefectDictSet for singlepoint (static) energy calculation of the _bulk_
                supercell with SOC included. Generated if `soc=True`. If `soc` is not
                set, then by default is only generated for systems with a max atomic
                number (Z) >= 31 (i.e. further down the periodic table than Zn).

            Input parameters are also set as attributes.

        Creates a dictionary of: {defect_species: DefectRelaxSet}.

        DefectRelaxSet has the attributes:
        - `DefectRelaxSet.vasp_gam` -> `DefectDictSet` for Gamma-point only
            relaxation. Not needed if ShakeNBreak structure searching has been
            performed (recommended), unless only Γ-point _k_-point sampling is
            required (converged) for your system, and no vasp_std calculations with
            multiple _k_-points are required (determined from kpoints settings).
        - `DefectRelaxSet.vasp_nkred_std` -> `DefectDictSet` for relaxation with a
            kpoint mesh and using `NKRED`. Not generated for GGA calculations (if
            `LHFCALC` is set to `False` in user_incar_settings) or if only Gamma
            kpoint sampling is required.
        - `DefectRelaxSet.vasp_std` -> `DefectDictSet` for relaxation with a kpoint
            mesh, not using `NKRED`. Not generated if only Gamma kpoint sampling is
            required.
        - `DefectRelaxSet.vasp_ncl` -> `DefectDictSet` for singlepoint (static)
            energy calculation with SOC included. Generated if `soc=True`. If `soc`
            is not set, then by default is only generated for systems with a max
            atomic number (Z) >= 31 (i.e. further down the periodic table than Zn).
        where `DefectDictSet` is an extension of `pymatgen`'s `DictSet` class for
        defect calculations, with `incar`, `poscar`, `kpoints` and `potcar`
        attributes for the corresponding VASP defect calculations (see docstring).

        See the `RelaxSet.yaml` and `DefectSet.yaml` files in the
        `doped/VASP_sets` folder for the default `INCAR` settings, and
        `PotcarSet.yaml` for the default `POTCAR` settings.

        Note that any changes to the default `INCAR`/`POTCAR` settings should
        be consistent with those used for all defect and competing phase (chemical
        potential) calculations.

        Args:
            defect_entries (`DefectsGenerator` or dict/list of `DefectEntry`s, or single `DefectEntry`):
                Either a `DefectsGenerator` object, or a dictionary/list of
                `DefectEntry`s, or a single `DefectEntry` object, for which
                to generate VASP input files.
                If a `DefectsGenerator` object or a dictionary (->
                {defect_species: DefectEntry}), the defect folder names will be
                set equal to `defect_species`. If a list or single `DefectEntry`
                object is provided, the defect folder names will be set equal to
                `DefectEntry.name` if the `name` attribute is set, otherwise
                generated according to the `doped` convention (see doped.generation).
                Defect charge states are taken from `DefectEntry.charge_state`.
            soc (bool):
                Whether to generate `vasp_ncl` DefectDictSet attribute for spin-orbit
                coupling singlepoint (static) energy calculations. If not set, then
                by default is set to True if the max atomic number (Z) in the
                structure is >= 31 (i.e. further down the periodic table than Zn).
            user_incar_settings (dict):
                Dictionary of user INCAR settings (AEXX, NCORE etc.) to override
                default settings. Highly recommended to look at output INCARs or the
                `RelaxSet.yaml` and `DefectSet.yaml` files in the `doped/VASP_sets`
                folder, to see what the default INCAR settings are. Note that any
                flags that aren't numbers or True/False need to be input as strings
                with quotation marks (e.g. `{"ALGO": "All"}`).
                (default: None)
            user_kpoints_settings (dict or Kpoints):
                Dictionary of user KPOINTS settings (in pymatgen DictSet() format)
                e.g. {"reciprocal_density": 123}, or a Kpoints object, to use for the
                `vasp_std`, `vasp_nkred_std` and `vasp_ncl` DefectDictSets (Γ-only for
                `vasp_gam`). Default is Gamma-centred, reciprocal_density = 100 [Å⁻³].
            user_potcar_functional (str):
                POTCAR functional to use. Default is "PBE" and if this fails, tries
                "PBE_52", then "PBE_54".
            user_potcar_settings (dict):
                Override the default POTCARs, e.g. {"Li": "Li_sv"}. See
                `doped/VASP_setsPotcarSet.yaml` for the default `POTCAR` set.
            **kwargs: Additional kwargs to pass to DictSet().

        Write VASP input files to folders for all defects in
        `self.defect_entries`. Folder names are set to the key of the
        DefectRelaxSet in `self.defect_sets` (same as self.defect_entries keys,
        see `DefectsSet` docstring).

        For each defect folder, the following subfolders are generated:
        - vasp_nkred_std -> Defect relaxation with a kpoint mesh and using `NKRED`.
            Not generated for GGA calculations (if `LHFCALC` is set to `False` in
            user_incar_settings) or if only Γ-point sampling required.
        - vasp_std -> Defect relaxation with a kpoint mesh, not using `NKRED`. Not
            generated if only Γ-point sampling required.
        - vasp_ncl -> Singlepoint (static) energy calculation with SOC included.
            Generated if `soc=True`. If `soc` is not set, then by default is only
            generated for systems with a max atomic number (Z) >= 31 (i.e. further
            down the periodic table than Zn).

        If vasp_gam=True (not recommended) or self.vasp_std = None (i.e. Γ-only
        _k_-point sampling converged for the kpoints settings used), then outputs:
        - vasp_gam -> Γ-point only defect relaxation. Not needed if ShakeNBreak
            structure searching has been performed (recommended).

        By default, does not generate a `vasp_gam` folder unless
        `DefectRelaxSet.vasp_std` is None (i.e. only Γ-point sampling required
        for this system), as `vasp_gam` calculations should be performed using
        `ShakeNBreak` for defect structure-searching and initial relaxations.
        If `vasp_gam` files are desired, set `vasp_gam=True`.

        By default, `POSCAR` files are not generated for the `vasp_(nkred_)std`
        (and `vasp_ncl` if `self.soc` is True) folders, as these should
        be taken from `ShakeNBreak` calculations (via `snb-groundstate`)
        or, if not following the recommended structure-searching workflow,
        from the `CONTCAR`s of `vasp_gam` calculations. If including SOC
        effects (`self.soc = True`), then the `vasp_std` `CONTCAR`s
        should be used as the `vasp_ncl` `POSCAR`s. If unperturbed
        `POSCAR` files are desired for the `vasp_(nkred_)std` (and `vasp_ncl`)
        folders, set `unperturbed_poscar=True`.

        Input files for the singlepoint (static) bulk supercell reference
        calculation are also written to "{formula}_bulk/{subfolder}" if `bulk`
        is True (default), where `subfolder` corresponds to the final (highest
        accuracy) VASP calculation in the workflow (i.e. `vasp_ncl` if
        `self.soc=True`, otherwise `vasp_std` or `vasp_gam` if only Γ-point
        reciprocal space sampling is required). If `bulk = "all"`, then the
        input files for all VASP calculations in the workflow are written to
        the bulk supercell folder, or if `bulk = False`, then no bulk folder
        is created.

        The `DefectEntry` objects are also written to `json` files in the defect
        folders, to aid calculation provenance.

        See the `RelaxSet.yaml` and `DefectSet.yaml` files in the
        `doped/VASP_sets` folder for the default `INCAR` and `KPOINT` settings,
        and `PotcarSet.yaml` for the default `POTCAR` settings. **These are
        reasonable defaults that _roughly_ match the typical values needed for
        accurate defect calculations, but usually will need to be modified for
        your specific system, such as converged ENCUT and KPOINTS, and NCORE /
        KPAR matching your HPC setup.**

        Note that any changes to the default `INCAR`/`POTCAR` settings should
        be consistent with those used for all defect and competing phase (
        chemical potential) calculations.

        Args:
            output_dir (str):
                Folder in which to create the VASP defect calculation folders.
                Default is the current directory ("."). Output folder structure
                is `<output_dir>/<defect_species>/<subfolder>` where
                `defect_species` is the key of the DefectRelaxSet in
                `self.defect_sets` (same as `self.defect_entries` keys, see
                `DefectsSet` docstring) and `subfolder` is the name of the
                corresponding VASP program to run (e.g. `vasp_std`).

                If True, write the unperturbed defect POSCARs to the generated
                folders as well. Not recommended, as the recommended workflow is
                to initially perform `vasp_gam` ground-state structure searching
                using ShakeNBreak (https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io), then
                continue the `vasp_std` relaxations from the 'Groundstate'
                `CONTCAR`s (first with NKRED if using hybrid DFT, then without),
                then use the `vasp_std` `CONTCAR`s as the input structures for
                the final `vasp_ncl` singlepoint calculations.

            vasp_gam (bool):
                If True, write the `vasp_gam` input files, with unperturbed defect
                POSCARs. Not recommended, as the recommended workflow is to initially

                the `vasp_std` `CONTCAR`s as the input structures for the final
                `vasp_ncl` singlepoint calculations.

                If True, the input files for a singlepoint calculation of the
                bulk supercell are also written to "{formula}_bulk/{subfolder}",
                where `subfolder` corresponds to the final (highest accuracy)
                VASP calculation in the workflow (i.e. `vasp_ncl` if `self.soc=True`,
                otherwise `vasp_std` or `vasp_gam` if only Γ-point reciprocal space
                sampling is required). If `bulk = "all"` then the input files for
                all VASP calculations in the workflow (`vasp_gam`, `vasp_nkred_std`,
                `vasp_std`, `vasp_ncl` (if applicable)) are written to the bulk
