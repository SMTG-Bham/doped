            Pymatgen DefectEntry to prepare VASP input files for.
        defect_dir (str):
            Folder in which to create the VASP defect calculation inputs.
            Default is the current directory.

            Output folder structure is `<defect_dir>/<subfolder>` where
            `subfolder` = 'vasp_gam' by default. Setting `subfolder` to `None` will write
            the `vasp_gam` input files directly to the `<defect_dir>` folder,
            with no subfolders created.

        user_incar_settings (dict):
            Dictionary of user INCAR settings (AEXX, NCORE etc.) to override default settings.
            Highly recommended to look at output INCARs or the `HSE06_RelaxSet.yaml` and
            `DefectSet.yaml` files in the `doped` folder, to see what the default INCAR settings

            (default: None)
        user_kpoints_settings (dict or Kpoints):
            Dictionary of user KPOINTS settings (in pymatgen DictSet() format) e.g.,
            {"reciprocal_density": 1000}, or a Kpoints object. Default KPOINTS is Gamma-point-only
            if `vasp_type = 'vasp_gam'`, else a Gamma-centred 2 x 2 x 2 mesh.
        user_potcar_functional (str): POTCAR functional to use (default = "PBE_54")
        user_potcar_settings (dict): Override the default POTCARs, e.g. {"Li": "Li_sv"}. See
            `doped/PotcarSet.yaml` for the default `POTCAR` set.
        unperturbed_poscar (bool):
            If True, write the unperturbed defect POSCARs to the generated folders as well. Not
            recommended, as the recommended workflow is to initially perform vasp_gam
            ground-state structure searching using ShakeNBreak (see example notebook;
            https://shakenbreak.readthedocs.io), then continue the vasp_std relaxations from the
            'Groundstate' CONTCARs.
            (default: False)
        write_files (bool): Whether to write the VASP input files to disk. Default is True.
        write_transformation_info (bool): Whether to write the transformation.json file (with info
            about generated defect supercell, mainly for logging purposes). Default is False.
