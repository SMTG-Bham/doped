    "In some cases the Materials Project may not have all known phases in a certain chemical space (e.g. in the La-Mn-O system discussed here), so it's a good idea to cross-check the generated competing phases with the [ICSD](https://icsd.products.fiz-karlsruhe.de/) in case you suspect any are missing.\n",

    "- Note that at present this uses the 'Legacy API' from the Materials Project, and so the API key you use (either in `~/.pmgrc.yaml` or supplied to `CompetingPhases` with the `api_key` parameter) should correspond to the Materials Project legacy API.
