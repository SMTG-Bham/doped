    "To calculate the limiting chemical potentials of elements in the material (needed for calculating the defect formation energies) we need to consider the energies of all competing phases. `doped` does this by calling the `CompetingPhases` Class, which then queries Materials Project to obtain all the relevant competing phases to be calculated.\n",
    "In some cases the Materials Project may not have all known phases in a certain chemical space, so it's a good idea to cross-check the generated competing phases with the [ICSD](https://icsd.products.fiz-karlsruhe.de/) in case you suspect any are missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this functionality to work correctly, you must have POTCARs set up to work with `pymatgen` and you will also need an [API key](https://legacy.materialsproject.org/open) for the Materials Project (both of which are described on the [Installation docs page](https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html)).\n",

    "**Note:** The current algorithm for how `doped` queries the Materials Project (MP) and determines relevant competing phases to be calculated, is that it first queries the MP for all phases with energies above hull less than `e_above_hull` (optional parameter in `CompetingPhases()`) in eV/atom in the chemical space of the host material. It then determines which of these phases border the host material in the phase diagram (i.e. which are competing phases and thus determine the chemical potentials), as well as which phases _would_ border the host material if their energies were downshifted by `e_above_hull`. The latter are included as well, and so `e_above_hull` acts as an uncertainty range for the MP-calculated formation energies, which may not be accurate due to functional choice (GGA vs hybrid DFT / GGA+U / RPA etc.), lack of vdW corrections etc.\n",
