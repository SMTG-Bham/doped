For general questions related to `doped` and defect modelling, we ask that you post these on the 
[`doped` MatSci community forum](https://matsci.org/c/doped/70).

Before taking developer time, we kindly ask that you first check the following curated resources for answers, as many
questions have been answered before:
- [ ] [`doped` documentation site](https://doped.readthedocs.io) – tip: use the search bar on the left.
- [ ] [`doped` tutorials](https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tutorials.html)
- [ ] [`doped` Python API docs](https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/doped.html)
- [ ] [Previous `doped` issues](https://github.com/SMTG-Bham/doped/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed) where the same question may have been asked – tip: use the search bar.
- [ ] All other `doped` docs pages; such as [Tips](https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tips.html), [Troubleshooting](https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Troubleshooting.html) and [Installation](https://doped.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Installation.html)
- [ ] [`doped` MatSci community forum](https://matsci.org/c/doped/70)

If your question is about general defect calculation methodology (rather than specific to `doped`), please refer to the 
following papers, and other relevant literature:
